I am writing this letter to you believers, the congregation that I love so much. God has chosen you, and I love you because of what we know about Christ is true! Not only do I myself love you, but all those who know and accept the true message that Jesus taught also love you!\n\n  <verse number=\"2\" style=\"v\" />This is because all of us believe God's true message. It is in our inner beings and we will continue to believe it forever!\n\n  <verse number=\"3\" style=\"v\" />God the Father and Jesus Christ, who is his Son, will continue to act kindly and mercifully toward us because they love us. They will enable us to have peace, because they truly love us.</para>\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-04", "img": "", "text": "<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"4\" style=\"v\" />I am very happy because I have learned that some of you are living according to the truth that God has taught us. this is just what our Father commanded us to do.</para>\n\n<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"5\" style=\"v\" />And now, dear congregation, I beg you to obey what he has commanded us to do. This  is why I am writing to you. What he commanded--that we should love each other--is nothing new; instead, it was when we first believed in Christ that we learned that we should love each other.\n\n  <verse number=\"6\" style=\"v\" />This is what it means to love God and each other--we should obey what God commands us to do.

They are the ones who refuse to believe that Jesus Christ became human. They are the ones who deceive others and oppose  Christ himself.\n\n  <verse number=\"8\" style=\"v\" />So be careful that you do not let those teachers deceive you! If you let them deceive you, you will lose the reward which we, together with you, have been working for, and you will not receive the complete reward of being eternally united to God!</para>\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-09", "img": "", "text": "<verse number=\"9\" style=\"v\" />Those who change what Christ taught and do not continue to believe what he taught are not joined with God.

Do not encourage him by greeting him or wishing him well in any way!\n\n<verse number=\"11\" style=\"v\" />I say that because if you treat people like that as you would treat a fellow believer, you are helping them do their evil deeds.\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-00", "img": "", "text": "<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"12\" style=\"v\" />Even though I have much more that I want to tell you, I have decided not to say it in a letter .
