I am a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother to James. I am writing to you whom God has called to him, to you whom God the Father loves, to you whom he is keeping for Jesus Christ.\n\n  <verse number=\"2\" style=\"v\" />May God have much mercy on you. May he give you much peace, and may he love you very much.</para>\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-03", "img": "", "text": "<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"3\" style=\"v\" />You whom I love, I tried very hard to write a letter to you about how God has saved us all together. I needed to write to encourage you to do your best to speak for  the true things that we believe. These are  things that God has taught all the believers. These things will never change.\n\n  <verse number=\"4\" style=\"v\" />Some people are like snakes crawling  into your aseemblies. They teach false things. they say that because God kindly does for us what we do not deserve, it does not matter how we live. In this way they oppose what is true about Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord. </para>\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-05", "img": "", "text": "<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"5\" style=\"v\" />Although you previously knew all these things, there are certain things about which I desire to remind you. Do not forget that although the Lord rescued his people from Egypt, he later destroyed most of those same people, those people who did not believe in him.\n\n  <verse number=\"6\" style=\"v\" />Also, there were many angels to whom God assigned positions of authority in heaven. But they did not continue to rule with authority in those positions. Instead, they abandoned those place. So God has put those angels in chains forever in darkness in hell. They will stay there until the important day in which God will judge and punish them.</para>\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-07", "img": "", "text": "<verse number=\"7\" style=\"v\" />Similarly, the people who lived  in Sodom and Gomorrah cities and the nearby cities committed sexual immorality. They sought all kinds of sexual relations that differ from what God permits. So God destroyed their cities. What happened to those people and those angels in heaven shows that God will punish people, such as the ones who teach false doctrine, in the eternal fire of hell.\n\n<verse number=\"8\" style=\"v\" />Similarly, these ungodly people in your midst also defile their own bodies by living immorally. They say that God has sent them visions that tell them to live like this. But they do not obey God's commands, and they insult his wonderful angels.\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-09", "img": "", "text": "<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"9\" style=\"v\" />Even when Michael the archangel argued with Satan about who would take possession of Moses' body, he kept from insulting and condemning him; he merely said, \"May the Lord punish you!\"\n\n  <verse number=\"10\" style=\"v\" />But these people about whom I am writing--they say evil words about everything good that they do not understand. They are just like wild animals that cannot think, bcause all the things that they are naturally able to understand--these things destroy them. </para>\n\n<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"11\" style=\"v\" />God will punish very severely those who do these things. They behave like Cain did. They commit the same sin as the sin Balaam committed for money, and they will die like Korah, who rebelled against Moses.</para>\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-12", "img": "", "text": "<verse number=\"12\" style=\"v\" />These people are like rocks under the water that ships crash against. When they share in your love-feasts, they have no shame, because they eat only to please themselves. They are like clouds that give no rain, clouds that the wind pushes along. They do no good deeds, for they are like trees in late autumn that bear no fruit. They are like people who have died two times; they are like trees that have been uprooted.\n\n<verse number=\"13\" style=\"v\" />They do not control themselves. They are like the sea's strong waves in a storm, and they pollute others with their shame, just as the waves bring up foam and dirt onto the beaches. They are like stars that do not stay where they should in the sky. God will put them in very great darkness forever.\n"}, {"format": "usx", "id": "01-14", "img": "", "text": "<para style=\"p\">\n\n  <verse number=\"14\" style=\"v\" />Enoch, the sixth person in the line of people who descended from Adam, said this about those teachers of false doctrine: \"Listen carefully to this: The Lord will certainly come with a countless number of his holy angels.\n\n  <verse number=\"15\" style=\"v\" />They will judge everyone and will punish all wicked people, and all who dishonor God. The angels will do this, because of all the harsh things that these people have spoken against God.\"\n\n  <verse number=\"16\" style=\"v\" />These teachers of false doctrine grumble about the things that God does. They complain about what happens to them. They do the evil things because they wish to do. They talk boastfully.

They will commit the sins with their bodies that they wish to commit because they dishonor God.\"\n\n  <verse number=\"19\" style=\"v\" />These are the people who make believers angry with each other. They do all the wicked things that they want to do.
