\s5
\v 1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
\p
\v 2 Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
\q Behold, I send my messenger before your face,
\q Who shall prepare your way;
\q
\v 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
\q Make you ready the way of the Lord,
\q Make his paths straight;
\m
\s5
\v 4 John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance to remission of sins.
\v 5 And there went out to him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the
river Jordan, confessing their sins.
\v 6 And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leather girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild
honey.
\s5
\v 7 And he preached, saying, There comes after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to
stoop down and unloose.
\v 8 I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
\p
\s5
\v 9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
\v 10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens tore asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon
him:
\v 11 and a voice came out of the heavens, You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased.
\p
\s5
\v 12 And straightway the Spirit drives him forth into the wilderness.
\v 13 And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to
him.
\p
\s5
\v 14 Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,
\v 15 and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.
\p
\s5
\v 16 And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they
were fishers.
\v 17 And Jesus said to them, Come you after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
\v 18 And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.
\s5
\v 19 And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat
mending the nets.
\v 20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after
him.
\p
\s5
\v 21 And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
\v 22 And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
\s5
\v 23 And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
\v 24 saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the
Holy One of God.
\v 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.
\v 26 And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
\s5
\v 27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with
authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
\v 28 And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
\p
\s5
\v 29 And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and
John.
\v 30 Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:
\v 31 and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered to them.
\p
\s5
\v 32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought to him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.
\v 33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.
\v 34 And he healed many that were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to
speak, because they knew him.
\p
\s5
\v 35 And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there
prayed.
\v 36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;
\v 37 and they found him, and say to him, All are seeking thee.
\s5
\v 38 And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I
forth.
\v 39 And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
\p
\s5
\v 40 And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him, If you wilt, you can
make me clean.
\v 41 And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and says to him, I will; be you made
clean.
\v 42 And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
\s5
\v 43 And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,
\v 44 and says to him, See you say nothing to any man: but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the
things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
\s5
\v 45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly
enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
