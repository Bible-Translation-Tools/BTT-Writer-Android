All translation activities are carried out according to these common guidelines.</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Accurate</strong> — Translate accurately, without  detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Clear</strong>  — Use whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes rearranging the form of a text and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Natural</strong>  — Use language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Faithful</strong>  — Avoid any political, denominational, ideological, social, cultural, or theological bias in your translation. Use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Use equivalent common language terms for the biblical words that describe the relationship between God the Father and God the Son. These may be clarified, as needed, in footnotes or other supplemental resources. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_faithful\" title=\"Create Faithful Translations\">Create Faithful Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Authoritative</strong>  — Use the original language biblical texts as the highest authority for translation of biblical content. Reliable biblical content in other languages may be used for clarification and as intermediary source texts. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_authoritative\" title=\"Create Authoritative Translations\">Create Authoritative Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Historical</strong>  — Communicate historical events and facts accurately, providing additional information as needed in order to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the original recipients of the original content. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_historical\" title=\"Create Historical Translations\">Create Historical Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Equal</strong> — Communicate the same intent as the source text, including expressions of feeling and attitudes. As much as possible, maintain the different kinds of literature in the original text, including narrative, poetry, exhortation, and prophecy, representing them with corresponding forms that communicate in a similar way in your language. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_equal\" title=\"Create Equal Translations\">Create Equal Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Identifying and Managing Translation Quality</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe quality of a translation generally refers to the fidelity of the translation to the meaning of the original, and the degree to which the translation is understandable and effective for the speakers of the receptor language. The strategy we suggest involves checking the forms and communicative quality of the translation with the language community, and checking the fidelity of the translation with the Church in that people group.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe specific steps involved may vary significantly, depending on the language and context of the translation project. Generally, we consider a good translation to be one that has been reviewed by the speakers of the language community and also by the leadership of the church in the language group so that it is:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Accurate, Clear, Natural, and Equal</strong> — Faithful to the intended meaning of the original, as determined by the Church in that people group and in alignment with the Church global and historical, and consequently:</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Affirmed by the Church</strong>  - Endorsed and used by the Church. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_church_approved\" title=\"Create Church-Approved Translations\">Create Church-Approved Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nWe also recommend that the translation work be:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Collaborative</strong> — Where possible, work together with other believers who speak your language to translate, check, and distribute the translated content, ensuring that it is of the highest quality and available to as many people as possible. (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_collaborative\" title=\"Create Collaborative Translations\">Create Collaborative Translations</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Ongoing</strong> — Translation work is never completely finished. Encourage those who are skilled with the language to suggest better ways to say things when they notice that improvements can be made. Any errors in the translation should also be corrected as soon as they are discovered. Also encourage the periodic review of translations to ascertain when revision or a new translation is needed.

A “gateway language” is a language of wider communication through which second-language speakers of that language can gain access to content and translate it into their own language. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe “gateway languages” at the world level comprise the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language, via translation by bilingual speakers. For example, French is a gateway language for minority languages in Francophone Africa in that content available in French can be translated by bilingual speakers from French into their own languages. \n</p>\n<p>\nAt the country level, the gateway languages of a given country are the fewest languages of wider communication required for bilingual speakers in every minority language native to the country (not located there due to immigration) to gain access to content. For example, English is the gateway language for North Korea, given that all people groups native to North Korea can be reached by translation of content into their language from English. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo read more about the Gateway Languages Strategy and to find out if your language is a gateway language go to <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://unfoldingword.org/gateway/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://unfoldingword.org/gateway/\">https://unfoldingword.org/gateway/</a> . \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Effects</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThis model has two basic effects: First, it empowers all languages to “pull” content to their language once the content and helps have been “pushed” into a language accessible to every language of the world (a gateway language). Second, it limits the amount of translation that needs to be done as the translation helps only have to be translated into the gateway language. All other languages can translate only the biblical content, since no language will be dependent upon them for understanding the translation helps.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThus, whether or not a language is a gateway language will determine what needs to be translated into that language. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor Other Languages, we recommend they translate at least Open Bible Stories. They are welcome to translate whatever other resources they like.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo see what must be translated for Gateway Languages, go to <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_translate\" title=\"Translating in the Gateways\">Translating in the Gateways</a>. If you are translating into a gateway language, you will find the Gateway Languages Manual (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/toc_gatewayvol2\" title=\"Gateway Languages Manual\">Gateway Languages Manual</a>) particularly helpful because it deals with certain issues that specifically appear for gateway languages. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_translate\" title=\"Translating in the Gateways\">Translating in the Gateways</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/intro/finding_answers\" title=\"Finding Answers\">Finding Answers</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

The speaker or writer has a certain meaning in mind, and so he or she chooses a form of the language to express that meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Context</strong> - The words, phrases, sentences, and paragraphs surrounding the word, phrase, or sentence in question. The context is the text that surrounds the part of the text that you are examining. The meaning of individual words and phrases can change when they are in different contexts.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Form</strong> - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. “Form” refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Grammar</strong> - The way that sentences are put together in a language. This has to do with the order of its various parts, such as if the verb goes first or last or in the middle. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Noun</strong> - A kind of word that refers to a person, place, or thing. A proper noun is the name of a person or place. An abstract noun is a thing that we cannot see or touch, like “peace” or “unity.” It refers to an idea or a state of being. Some languages do not use abstract nouns.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Verb</strong> - A kind of word that refers to an action, like “walk” or “arrive.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Modifier</strong> - A kind of word that says something about another word. Both adjectives and adverbs are modifiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Adjective</strong> - A kind of word that says something about a noun. For example, the word “tall” says something about the noun “man” in the following sentence. <em>I see a tall man</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Adverb</strong> - A kind of word that says something about a verb. For example, the word “loudly” says something about the verb “spoke” in the following sentence. <em>The man spoke loudly to the crowd of people</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Idiom</strong> - An expression that uses several words and that means something different as a whole than it would if the words were understood with the meanings that they have when they are used separately. Idioms cannot be translated literally, that is, with the meanings of the separate words. For example, “He kicked the bucket” is an idiom in English that means, “He died.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Meaning</strong> - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Translation</strong> - The act of expressing the meaning conveyed by the form of one language in the form of another language.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Source Language</strong> - The language <em>from</em> which the translation is being made.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Source Text</strong>- The text <em>from</em> which the translation is being made.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Target Language</strong> - The language <em>into</em> which a translation is being made.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Target Text</strong>- The text being made by the translator as he or she translates the meaning from the source text.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Original Language</strong> - The language in which a Bible text was initially written. The Original Language of the New Testament is Greek. The Original Language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the Original Language of some parts of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The Original Language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Language of Wider Communication</strong> - A language that is spoken over a broad area and by many people. For most people, this is not their first language, but is the language that they use to speak to people outside of their language community. Some people call this a trade language. Most Bibles will be translated using a language of wider communication as the source language.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Literal Translation</strong> - A translation that focuses on reproducing the form of the source text in the target text, even if the meaning changes as a result.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Meaning-based Translation (or Dynamic Translation)</strong> - A translation that focuses on reproducing the meaning of the source text in the target text, even if the form changes as a result.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Passage</strong> - A section of the Bible text that is being talked about. This can be as small as one verse, but it is usually several verses that together have one topic or tell one story. \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Gateway Language</strong> - A Gateway Language (GL) is a language of wider communication that we have identified as being one of the languages into which we will translate all of our translation tools. The set of Gateway Languages is the smallest number of languages through which content can be delivered to every other language of the world, through translation by bilingual speakers.  \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Language</strong> - The Other Languages (OLs) are all of the languages of the world that are not Gateway Languages. We translate our Bible translation tools into the Gateway Languages so that people can use those tools to translate the Bible into the Other Languages.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>End-user Bible</strong> - This is a Bible that people have translated so that it speaks in a natural way in the target language. It is meant to be used in churches and homes. In contrast, the ULB and UDB are Bibles that are translation tools. They do not speak naturally in any language, because the ULB is a literal translation and the UDB avoids using idioms and figures of speech, which a natural translation would use. Using these translation tools, a translator can produce an end-user Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Participant</strong> - A participant is one of the actors in a sentence. This could be the person doing the action, or the person that is receiving the action, or mentioned as participating in some way. A participant could even be an object that is stated as participating in the action of the sentence. For example, in the following sentence, the participants are underlined: <em><em class=\"u\">John</em> and <em class=\"u\">Mary</em> sent <em class=\"u\">a letter</em> to <em class=\"u\">Andrew</em>.</em> Sometimes participants are left unstated, but they are still part of the action. In this case, the participant is <em>implied</em>. For example, in the following sentence, there are only two participants stated: <em><em class=\"u\">Andrew</em> received <em class=\"u\">a letter</em>.</em> The senders, John and Mary, are implied. In some languages, the implied participants must be stated.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_whatis\" title=\"What is Translation\">What is Translation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Of all the types of work you could do, perhaps the greatest investment you could ever make is translating God’s Word into your language for the sake of helping your people grow as disciples of Jesus. It is essential for you to be committed to this task, to take your responsibility very seriously, and to pray that the Lord will help you in this highly important endeavor.\n</p>\n<p>\nGod has spoken to us in the Bible. He originally inspired the writers of the Bible to write his Word using the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek languages. He used about 40 different authors over a period from about 1400 B.C. to A.D. 100 to record his word in the languages which were spoken at that time in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. By recording his Word in those languages, God ensured that the people at those times and in those places could understand what was written.\n</p>\n<p>\nToday, however, your people in your country do not understand Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, so it is necessary to translate God’s Word into the language which they speak. In this way, they will be able to fully understand the message from God to them.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe often speak of someone’s mother tongue or heart language, which usually means the language they first spoke as a child and the one which they use at home. It is the language in which they are most comfortable and which they use to express their deepest thoughts. We want you and your people to be able to read God's Word in your and their heart language.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is important to know that every language is important and valuable. Your dialect is just as important as the national language spoken in your country. You should not be ashamed to speak your dialect. It is no less important than other more well-known languages and it can express meaning just as well as they can. Sometimes, those in minority groups like you feel ashamed of their language and try not to use it around the people who are in the majority in their nation. But there is nothing inherently more important, more prestigious, or more educated about the national language than there is about your local language. There are nuances and shades of meaning in your language which are very important. Each one of us should speak whichever language we are most comfortable with and with which we can express the feelings, thoughts and desires of our hearts. Each one of us needs to have God’s Word in our heart language.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Credits: Taken from “Bible Translation Theory &amp; Practice” by Todd Price, Ph.D. CC BY-SA 4.0</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_intro\" title=\"The Qualities of a Good Translation\">The Qualities of a Good Translation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_process\" title=\"The Translation Process\">The Translation Process</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

It must be:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Clear - see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Natural - see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Accurate - see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Church-Approved - see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_church_approved\" title=\"Create Church-Approved Translations\">Create Church-Approved Translations</a></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe can think of each of these qualities as a leg of a four-legged stool. Each one is necessary. If one is missing, the stool will not stand. Likewise, each of these qualities must be present in a translation in order for it to be useful and faithful to the church. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Clear</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nUse whatever language structures are necessary to achieve the highest level of comprehension. This includes simplifying concepts, rearranging the form of a text, and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as accurately as possible. To learn how to make Clear Translations, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Natural</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nUse language forms that are effective and that reflect the way your language is used in corresponding contexts. To learn how to make Natural Translations, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Accurate</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nTranslate accurately, without detracting from, changing, or adding to the meaning of the original text. Translated content should faithfully communicate as precisely as possible the meaning of the original text as it would have been understood by the original audience. Translate with the meaning of the text in mind and communicate accurately the implicit information, unknown concepts and figures of speech. To learn how to make Accurate Translations, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Church-Approved</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIf a translation is clear, natural, and accurate but the church does not approve of it or accept it, then it does not achieve the final goal of edifying the church. It is important that the church be involved in the translation, checking, and distribution of the translation.

This includes putting the text into a different form or arrangement and using as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible. \n</p>\n<p>\nHere are some ideas to create a clear translation from the source text into your language:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> You may need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause if it is in some other form, such as an abstract noun.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> You may need to change passive verbs to the active form.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by “of.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Check Pronouns</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nYou will need to check the pronouns in the source text and make it clear to whom or what each pronoun refers. Pronouns are words that stand in the place of a noun or a noun phrase. They refer back to something that has already been mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlways check carefully that it is clear to whom or what each pronoun refers.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Identify Participants</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nNext you need to understand who is doing the action. A clear translation will identify the PARTICIPANTS. The PARTICIPANTS in an event are the people or things that take part in that event. The subject that is doing the action and the object that has the action done to it are the main PARTICIPANTS. When re-expressing an EVENT idea as a verb, it is often necessary to state who or what are the PARTICIPANTS in that event. Usually this will be clear from the context.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Clearly Express Event Ideas</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nA clear translation may need to express EVENT ideas as verbs. You may need to change each EVENT idea into an active clause to be sure it is understood. \n</p>\n<p>\nWhen preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. See if you can re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. If, however, your language also uses nouns to express EVENT ideas and the event or action sounds more natural as a noun, then use the noun form.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Passive Verbs</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nA clear translation may need to change any PASSIVE verbs to the ACTIVE form.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the ACTIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person who does the action. In the PASSIVE form, the subject of the sentence is the person or thing to which the action is done. For example, “John hit Bill” is an active sentence. “Bill was hit by John” is a passive sentence.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany languages do not have a PASSIVE form, only the ACTIVE form exists. Therefore, it may be necessary to turn a sentence from the PASSIVE form into the ACTIVE form.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Look at Each 'Of' Phrase</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nTo make a clear translation, you will also need to look at each “of” phrase to identify the meaning of the relationship between the nouns connected by “of.” In many languages, “of” constructions are not as frequent as they are in Greek, the original language of the New Testament books. Study the meaning of each one and re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter you have checked these things and made your translation as clear as possible, you will need to read it to other people who speak your language to see if it is clear to them. If there are parts that they do not understand, it may be because that part is not clear. Together, you can think of a clearer way to say that part. Keep checking the translation with many people until all of it is clear.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember: Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Writing Clearly</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nAlso ask yourself the following questions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Have you effectively used punctuation to help a reader know when to pause or to breathe?  </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Have you indicated which parts are direct speech?  </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Are you separating paragraphs?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Have you followed the verse numbering of your source text and included it in your translation?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese points are also important in keeping a translation clear and easy to read.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_church_approved\" title=\"Create Church-Approved Translations\">Create Church-Approved Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_process\" title=\"The Translation Process\">The Translation Process</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Here are some ideas for making a natural translation:\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Use Short Sentences</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIn order for a translation to sound natural, sometimes it is necessary to create shorter, simpler sentences from longer, complex ones. The Greek language often has long, grammatically complicated sentences. Some Bible translations follow the Greek structure closely and keep these long sentences in their translation, even when this does not sound natural or is confusing in the target language. \n</p>\n<p>\nWhen preparing to translate, it is often helpful to rewrite the passage, breaking long sentences up into shorter sentences. This can help you to see the meaning more clearly and translate it better. In many languages, it is good style to have shorter sentences, or, when sentences are longer, to avoid having complicated sentences. So in re-expressing the meaning in the Target Language, it is sometimes necessary to break up some of the original long sentences into several shorter sentences. Because many languages use sentences with only one or two clause groupings, the shorter sentences will give a sense of naturalness. The shorter sentences will also give readers a better understanding, because the meaning will be clearer. Be sure to include clear connection words between the new, shorter clauses and sentences.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make shorter sentences from longer, more complex sentences, identify the words in the sentence that relate directly to each other, that is, that belong together to form a clause. Generally, each verb or action word has words on either side of it that point back to or forward to the action of the verb. A grouping of words like this that can stand on its own may be written as an independent clause or a simple sentence. Keep each of those groups of words together and in that way divide the sentence into its separate ideas or parts. Then test your translation by reading it to a member of the language community to see if it sounds natural. <br/>\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Write the Way Your People Talk</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nRead the passage or chapter of the Bible and ask yourself, “what kind of message is this?” Then translate that passage or chapter in the way that your language would communicate that kind of message.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, if the passage is a poem, such as in the Psalms, then translate it in the form that your people will recognize as a poem. \nOr if the passage is an exhortation about the right way to live, such as in the New Testament letters, then translate it in a form that people in your language exhort each other.\nOr if the passage is a story about what someone did, translate it in the form of a story (that really happened).\nThe Bible has a lot of these kinds of stories, and as part of these stories people say things to each other that also have their own form. For example, people make threats, give warnings, and praise or rebuke each other. To make your translation natural, you should translate each of these things in the way that people in your language make threats, give warnings, praise or rebuke each other, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to know how to write these different things, you may have to listen to what people say around you, and practice writing down different things that people say and do, so that you become familiar with the form and words that people use for these different purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\nA good translation will use the same vocabulary and expressions as the people of the target group normally use. It should be easy for them to read it or listen to it. There should not be any awkward or strange phrases. The translation should read as easily as a letter from a close friend. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_church_approved\" title=\"Create Church-Approved Translations\">Create Church-Approved Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_process\" title=\"The Translation Process\">The Translation Process</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Here are some steps to follow:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Discover the meaning of a passage.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Identify the main idea.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Translate with the author’s message in mind.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Discover the Meaning</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nFirst, read each passage a few times to discover the meaning. Use the two versions of the Bible available in translationStudio: the Unlocked Dynamic Bible and the Unlocked Literal Bible. Also read the definitions of the translationWords and the translationNotes.\n</p>\n<p>\nLuke 10:8 and 9 in the Unlocked Dynamic Bible say: “Whenever you enter a town and the people there welcome you, eat whatever food they provide for you. Heal the people there who are sick. Tell them, 'The kingdom of God is right here near you.‘”\n</p>\n<p>\nThose same verses in the Unlocked Literal Bible say: “Whatever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you, and heal the sick that are there. Say to them, 'The kingdom of God has come near to you.‘”\n</p>\n<p>\nDo you notice the differences? There are some differences in the words each Bible version uses.\n</p>\n<p>\nDid you discover the meaning is the same? In both versions Jesus is giving specific instructions, and they are the same instructions. Both versions are accurate translations.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Identify the Main Idea</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThen, after discovering the meaning of the passage, you should identify the main idea.\n</p>\n<p>\nAsk yourself, “Why is the author writing this, and how does he feel about these things?\n</p>\n<p>\nLook at the Luke 10 passage again. Why do you think the author is writing this? What do you think the author feels about what he wrote? What do you think? After you have read the passage several times, answer these questions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> What is happening? <em>Jesus gave instructions.</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> When and where did these things take place? <em>To answer this question, you would need to remember what happened earlier. Earlier Luke writes that Jesus and the disciples are on the way to Jerusalem and chapter 10 starts with Jesus sending out 72 people to preach.</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Who is involved in this passage? <em>Jesus and the 72 people he sent out.</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Why were the 72 sent out? <em>To heal the sick and to tell everyone that the kingdom of God is near.</em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >The Message of the Writer</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nFinally, part of translating the source text accurately is to think of the original audience and the message of the writer.\n</p>\n<p>\nDo you think the author had specific things for the reader to know? Remember what we thought the author’s main ideas were? The main ideas were:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The instructions that Jesus gave</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> That the 72 people whom Jesus sent out would have power to heal sick people</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> That they would tell others that the kingdom of God was near</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis is the message to the original audience. Allow the same message to come clearly into your mind in the target language.\n</p>\n<p>\nLook at the passage and think how you would retell it in your own language. Keep this initial translation by writing it down. Use an alphabet that suits your language.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Remember:</strong> Translation is re-telling, as exactly as possible, the meaning of the original message in a way that is clear and natural in the target language.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_church_approved\" title=\"Create Church-Approved Translations\">Create Church-Approved Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_process\" title=\"The Translation Process\">The Translation Process</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

All three of these directly affect the words and phrases that are used in the translation. If a translation is not one of these three, simply changing or reordering the words that were used can often fix the problem. The fourth quality, church-approved, has less to do with the words used and more to do with the process that is used. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >The Goal of Translation</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe goal of the translation of biblical content is not only to produce a high-quality translation, but to produce a high-quality translation that is used and loved by the church. High-quality translations must be clear, natural, and accurate. But for a translation to be used and loved by the church, it must be church-approved. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >How to Create a Church-Approved Translation</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nCreating a church-approved translation is all about the process of translation, checking, and distribution. The more church networks that are involved in these processes, the more likely they will approve of the translation.\n</p>\n<p>\nBefore starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. \n</p>\n<p>\nIt is not necessary that the church actively lead the translation and coordinate all the efforts, but it is necessary that whoever is leading the translation be approved by the church networks, preferably before they even start. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Church Approval and the Checking Levels</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe need for church-approval of a translation is clearly reflected in the Checking Levels. In fact, the Checking Levels are largely a measurement of how broadly the church approves of the translation.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Level 1 states that the church-approved translation team has approved the translation. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Level 2 states that the pastors and leaders of local churches approve the translation.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Level 3 states that leaders of multiple church networks approve of the translation. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAt each level, the people leading the translation should encourage participation and input from the church networks. By using this process, we hope to encourage church ownership of the translation among as many church networks as possible. With this approval, there should be nothing hindering the translation from being used to strengthen and encourage the church. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/intro_check\" title=\"Introduction to the Checking Manual\">Introduction to the Checking Manual</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Imagine you were there. Imagine how people felt.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> When translating the Bible, always use at least two versions of the Bible together as your source text. Comparing two versions will help you to think about the meaning, so that you do not just follow the words of one version literally. The two versions should be:</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level3\"><div class=\"li\"> One version that follows the form of the original language fairly closely, such as the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level3\"><div class=\"li\"> One meaning-based version, such as the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB).</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use the translationWords resources to learn about terms that you are not familiar with. Words sometimes have more than one meaning. Make sure that you have understood the right meaning of the word in the passage.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Also use the translationNotes that are with the ULB Bible. These are available in the translationStudio program and the Door43 website. These will explain things about the passage that may not be clear.

They have the following definitions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Form</strong> - The structure of the language as it appears on the page or as it is spoken. “Form” refers to the way that the language is arranged - it includes the words, the word order, the grammar, idioms, and any other features of the structure of the text.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Meaning</strong> - The underlying idea or concept that the text is trying to communicate to the reader or hearer. A speaker or writer can communicate the same meaning by using different forms of the language, and different people can understand different meanings from hearing or reading the same language form. In this way you can see that form and meaning are not the same thing.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >An Example</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nLet's consider an example from normal life. Suppose a friend sent you the note below:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“I am having a very difficult week. My mother was sick and I spent all of my money to take her to the doctor and to buy medicine for her. I don't have anything left. My employer will not pay me until next weekend. I don't know how I am going to make it through the week. I don't even have money to buy food.”</div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<h4 >The Meaning</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nWhy do you think the friend sent this note? Just to tell you about his week? Probably not. His true intention was more likely to tell you:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“I need you to give me money.”</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThat is the primary <strong>meaning</strong> of the note that the sender wanted to communicate to you. However, it would be rude in some cultures to ask for money so directly—even from a friend. Therefore, he adjusted the <strong>form</strong> of the note to fill out the request and help you to understand his need. He wrote in a culturally-acceptable way that presented his need for money but did not obligate you to respond. He explained why he had no money (his sick mother), that his need was only temporary (until he is paid), and that his situation was desperate (no food). In other cultures, a more direct form of request might be more appropriate to communicate this meaning.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >The Form</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIn this example, the <strong>form</strong> is the entire text of the note. The <strong>meaning</strong> is “I need you to give me money!”\n</p>\n<p>\nWe use these terms in a similar way. <strong>Form</strong> will refer to the entire text of the verses that we are translating. <strong>Meaning</strong> will refer to the idea or ideas that the text is trying to communicate. The best form for communicating a certain meaning will be different in different languages and cultures.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_literal\" title=\"Literal Translations\">Literal Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_dynamic\" title=\"Meaning-Based Translations\">Meaning-Based Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_levels\" title=\"Levels of Meaning\">Levels of Meaning</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_form\" title=\"The Importance of Form\">The Importance of Form</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

However, the form of the text is also very important. It is more than just a “container” for the meaning. It affects the way the meaning is understood and received. So the form itself also has a meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, look at the differences in form between these translations of Psalm 9:1-2:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nI will give thanks to the Lord with all my heart. I will tell of all the great things You have done. I will be glad and full of joy because of You. I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.  (New Life Version)</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nI will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart;<br/>\nI will tell of all your wonderful deeds.<br/>\nI will be glad and exult in you;<br/>\nI will sing praise to your name, O Most High.  (New Revised Standard Version)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe first version puts the text into a form that is no different than the form it uses for telling stories. Each line of the Psalm is stated as a separate sentence.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the second version, the text is arranged as lines of poetry are arranged in the target culture, with each line of the poem on a separate line of the page. Also, the first two lines are joined with a semi-colon, with the second line indented. These things indicate that they are related - they say very similar things. The third and fourth lines also have the same arrangement.\n</p>\n<p>\nA reader of the second version will know that this Psalm is a poem or a song because of the form that it has, while the reader of the first version may not get that understanding, because it was not communicated through the form of the text. The reader of the first version might be confused, because the Psalm seems to be a song, but it is not presented as one. The words are expressing a joyful emotion. As a translator, you should use the form for expressing a joyful song in your language.\n</p>\n<p>\nLook also at the form of 2 Samuel 18:33b:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you–O Absalom, my son, my son!” (New International Version)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nSomeone might say that the meaning contained in this part of the verse is, “I wish that I had died instead of my son Absalom.” This does summarize the meaning contained in the words. But the form communicates much more than just that content. The repetition of “my son” so many times, the repetition of the name “Absalom,” the expression “O,” the wish form “If only…” all communicate a strong emotion of deep anguish on the part of a father who has lost a son. As a translator, you need to translate not just the meaning of the words, but also the meaning of the form. For 2 Samuel 18:33b, it is important that you use a form that communicates the same emotion as contained in the original language.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo we need to examine the form of the biblical text and ask ourselves why it has that form and not some other one. What attitude or emotion is it communicating? Other questions that might help us to understand the meaning of the form are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Who wrote it?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Who received it?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> In what situation was it written?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Which words and phrases were chosen and why?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Are the words very emotional words, or is there anything special about the order of the words?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWhen we understand the meaning of the form, then we can choose a form that has that same meaning in the target language and culture.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Culture Affects Meaning</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe meaning of forms is determined by culture. The same form might have different meanings in different cultures. In translation, the meaning must remain the same, including the meaning of the form. This means that the form of the text must change to fit the culture. The form includes the language of the text, its arrangement, any repetitions, or any expressions that imitate sounds like “O.” You must examine all of these things, decide what they mean, and then decide which form will express that meaning in the best way for the target language and culture.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_literal\" title=\"Literal Translations\">Literal Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_dynamic\" title=\"Meaning-Based Translations\">Meaning-Based Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_levels\" title=\"Levels of Meaning\">Levels of Meaning</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

But this meaning is determined by the context that the word is in. For example, a single word like “give” may have the following possible meanings, depending on the context:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to grant a gift</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to collapse or break</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to surrender</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to quit</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to concede</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to supply</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> etc.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Building the Larger Meaning</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe translator must determine what each word means in the context, and then reproduce the same meaning in the translated text. These words then combine into phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Therefore, the translator must also make sure that the words fit together into equivalent phrases, sentences, paragraphs, etc. so that the translated text has the same meaning on each level.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_literal\" title=\"Literal Translations\">Literal Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_dynamic\" title=\"Meaning-Based Translations\">Meaning-Based Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

An extreme version of a literal translation would not be a translation at all—it would have the same characters and words as the source language. The next closest step would be to replace each word in the source language with an equivalent word from the target language. Because of differences in grammar between languages, the target language audience would probably not understand this kind of translation. Some translators of the Bible wrongly believe that they should keep the word order of the source text in the target text and only substitute target language words for source language words. They wrongly believe that this shows respect for the source text as God's word. But in fact this kind of translation keeps people from understanding God's word. God wants people to understand his word, so it shows the greatest respect for the Bible and for God to translate the Bible so people can understand it.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Weaknesses of Literal Translation</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nLiteral translations usually contain the following problems:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> foreign words that are not understood by the target audience</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> word order that is strange or awkward in the target language</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> idioms that are not used or understood in the target language</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> names of objects that do not exist in the target culture</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> descriptions of customs that are not understood in the target culture</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> paragraphs that have no logical connections in the target language</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> stories and explanations that do not make sense in the target language</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_dynamic\" title=\"Meaning-Based Translations\">Meaning-Based Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

It is not the best choice for doing good translations. A word-for-word translation simply substitutes an equivalent word in the target language for each word in the source language. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >In word-for-word translations</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The focus is on one word at a time. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The natural sentence structure, phrase structures and figures of speech of the target language are ignored. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> The process of word-for-word translation is very simple.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> The first word in the source text is translated by an equivalent word. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Then the next word is done. This process continues until the verse is translated. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The word-for-word approach is attractive because it is so simple. However, it results in a poor quality translation.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWord-for-word substitution results in translations that are awkward to read. They are often confusing and give the wrong meaning or even no meaning at all. You should avoid doing this type of translation.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Examples</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n</div>\n<h5 >Word Order</h5>\n<div class=\"level5\">\n<p>\nHere is an example of Luke 3:16 in the NET Bible. It says:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nJohn answered them all, “I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.“</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThat translation is clear and easy to understand. But suppose the translators had used the word-for-word method. What would the translation be like?\n</p>\n<p>\nHere, translated in English, are the words in the same order as the original Greek.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nanswered  saying  to all  the  John  I  indeed  with water  baptize  you  he comes  but  who mightier than I of whom not I am worthy untie the strap of the sandals of him he you will baptize with spirit holy and fire</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis translation is awkward and can be hard to understand in English. How does it sound in your language?\n</p>\n<p>\nLook at the NET version above again. Notice the difference. The English NET translators did not keep the original Greek word order. They moved words around in the sentence to fit the rules of English grammar. They also changed some of the phrasing. For example, the English NET Bible said “John answered them” rather than “John answered to all saying,”  They used different words to make the text sound natural in English.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is important that the final result communicates the same meaning as the Greek text. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn this example the NET is a much better English translation than the awkward word-for-word version.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h5 >Range of Word Meanings</h5>\n<div class=\"level5\">\n<p>\nIn addition, word-for-word substitution does not take into account that most individual words have a range of meanings. In word-for-word translations only one meaning is chosen. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, the Greek word <em>aggelos</em> can refer to a human messenger or to an angel.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Luke 7:27, the word <em>aggelos</em> refers to a human messenger. Jesus was talking about John the Baptist when he said “This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.’\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Luke 2:15, it refers to angels when it says “when the angels went away from them into the sky.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA word-for-word substitution might translate the Greek word in both verses as “messenger” or “angel” even though it is used to refer to two different kinds of beings. This would be confusing to the reader.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h5 >Figures of Speech</h5>\n<div class=\"level5\">\n<p>\nFinally, word-for-word substitution does not convey the meaning of a figure of speech.\n</p>\n<p>\nFigures of Speech have meanings that are different from the individual words that they are made up of. When they are translated word-for-word, their meanings are not clear. Even if they are translated so that they follow the normal word order of they language they are translated into, their meaning may not be clear.

However, we must keep in mind that people from different cultures understand the meaning of forms differently. In different cultures, the same form may be understood in very different ways. Therefore it is not possible to protect the meaning from change by keeping the original forms. The only way to protect the meaning is to change the original form to a new form that communicates the same meaning in the new culture as the old form did in the old culture.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Different languages use different orders of words and phrases</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIf you keep the source word order in  your translation, it will be very difficult, and sometimes impossible, for the people who speak your language to understand it. You must use the natural word order of the target language so that people can understand the meaning of the text.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Different languages use different idioms and expressions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nEach language has its own idioms and other expressions, such as words that represent sounds or emotions. In order to express the meaning of these things, you must choose an idiom or expression that has that same meaning in the target language, not just translate each word. If you do that, the idiom or expression will have the wrong meaning.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Some terms do not have equivalents in other cultures</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe Bible contains many terms for things that no longer exist, such as ancient weights (stadia, cubit), money (denarius, stater) and measures (hin, ephah). Animals in Scripture may not exist in some parts of the world (fox, camel). Other words may be unknown in some cultures (snow, circumcision). It is not possible to simply substitute equivalent words for these terms in those situations. The translator must find another way to communicate the original meaning.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit6\" >The Bible was intended to be understood</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe testimony of the Scriptures themselves shows that they were meant to be understood. The Bible is written in three languages because the language of the people changed. When the Jews returned from exile and no longer remembered Hebrew, the priests translated the Old Testament readings into Aramaic so they could understand (Neh 8:8). Later, when the New Testament was written, it was written in the common Koine Greek, which was the language that most people spoke at that time, rather than Hebrew or Aramaic or even classical Greek, which would have been harder for common people to understand.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese and other reasons demonstrate that God wants people to understand his word. So we know that he wants us to translate the meaning of the Bible, not reproduce the form. The meaning of the Scriptures is more important than the form.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_dynamic\" title=\"Meaning-Based Translations\">Meaning-Based Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Now, we will look at meaning-based translations.\n</p>\n<p>\nMeaning-based translations are also called: \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> meaning-equivalent</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> idiomatic</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> dynamic</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Key Characteristic</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe key characteristic of meaning-based translations is that they give priority to translating the meaning over reproducing the form of the source text. That is, they <strong>change the form of the text as needed in order to make the meaning clear.</strong>  The most common types of changes that meaning-based translations make are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> change word order to match the grammar of the target language</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> change order of reasons or results to match the normal order of the flow of logic in the target language</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> substitute or explain idioms</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> explain or translate terms from other languages (ex: “Golgotha” = “place of the skull”)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> use phrases with simpler words instead of trying to find single word equivalents for difficult or uncommon words in the source text</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> replace terms that are unknown in the target culture with equivalent terms or descriptions</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\">replace connecting words that the target language does not use with connecting words that the target language needs</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples of Meaning-Based Translations</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWhat does a meaning-based translation look like? We will look at how different versions translate the same verse.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Luke 3:8, <em>John the Baptist rebukes the self-righteous people who came to be baptized.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe <strong>Greek </strong>  text of the first half of the verse is shown below.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nΠοιήσατε οὖν καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe <strong>English </strong>  translation in the same order as each Greek word, with some alternative English words to choose from, is below.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nDo/make/produce therefore fruits fit/appropriate of the repentance</div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<h4 >Literal</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nA literal translation would usually follow the words and order of the Greek text as closely as possible, such as the following.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nTherefore bear fruits in keeping with repentance, … (NASB)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nNote that this fairly-literal translation retains the words “fruits” and “repentance.” The word order is also very similar to the Greek text.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Meaning-Based</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nMeaning-based translations, on the other hand, are more likely to change the words and order if the translators think it will help to clarify the meaning. Consider these two meaning-based translations:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n…prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds.  (Living Bible)</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nProve by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.  (New Living Translation)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nNotice that both of these translations have changed the word order to be more natural in English. Also, the word “fruits” no longer appears. In fact, the LB translation does not use any of the words in the NASB translation. Instead, rather than “fruits,” the meaning-based translations refer to “deeds” or to “the way you live.” “Fruits” in this verse is used as part of a metaphor. The meaning of “fruits” in this metaphor is “the things that a person does.” (See the teaching module on Metaphor.) So these translations translated the meaning in context, rather than just the word. They also used more understandable phrases such as, “turned from sin” rather than the single difficult word, “repentance,” or they explained the word by saying, “repented of your sins and turned to God.”  The meaning in all of them is the same, but the form is very different. In the meaning-based translations, the meaning is much clearer. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_tform\" title=\"Translate for Meaning\">Translate for Meaning</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

These original writers used whatever language that they and their people spoke at the time when God gave his message so that they and their people could understand God's messages. God wants people today to understand those same messages. But people today do not speak those languages that the Bible was written in long ago. So God has given us the task of translating the Bible into the languages that people speak today. \n</p>\n<p>\nFrom this we can see that the particular language that people use to communicate God's messages is not important. The particular words that are used is not important. What is important is the meaning that those words communicate. The meaning is the message, not the words or the language. What we must translate, then, is not the words or the forms of the sentences of the  source languages, but the meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\nLook at the pairs of sentences below. \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It rained all night.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Rain fell all night.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> John was very surprised when he heard the news.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The news very much amazed John when he heard it.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It was a hot day.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The day was hot.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Peter’s house</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The house that belongs to Peter</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou can see that the meaning of each pair of sentences is the same, even though they use different words. This is the way it is in a good translation. We will use different words than the source text, but we will keep the meaning the same. We will use words that our people understand and use them in a way that is natural for our language. Communicating the same meaning as the source text in a clear and natural way is the goal of translation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Credits: Example sentences from Barnwell, pp. 19-20, © SIL International 1986, used by permission.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/choose_team\" title=\"Choosing a Translation Team\">Choosing a Translation Team</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

This module will discuss the skills that will be needed by members of the Bible translation team, and the responsibilities that these people will have. Some people will have many skills and responsibilities, and other people will have only a few. But it is important that every Bible translation team include enough people to make sure that all of these skills are represented on the team.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Church Leaders</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nBefore starting a translation project, as many church networks as possible should be contacted and encouraged to become a part of the translation and even to send some of their people to be a part of the translation team. They should be consulted and asked for their input into the translation project, its goals, and its process. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Translation Committee</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIt is good if the leaders of these churches and church networks can form a committee to guide the work, choose the translators, resolve problems that arise, and encourage the churches to pray for the work and to support the work financially. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis committee can also choose the people who will check the translation for accuracy at levels 2 and 3.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen it comes time, this committee can also make decisions about the format of the translation, how it will be distributed, and they can encourage the churches to use the translated Scriptures.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Translators</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThese are the people who will do the work of making the translation drafts. They will be appointed by the Translation Committee. They need to be people who are native speakers of the target language, who can read the source language very well, and who are respected in the community for their Christian character. For more details about these things, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/qualifications\" title=\"Translator Qualifications\">Translator Qualifications</a>. \n</p>\n<p>\nAs well as making the first drafts, these people will form the core of the translation team that will check each other's work, check the translation with the language community, and receive the suggestions for revision from the level 2 and level 3 checkers. After each review or checking session, these translators are responsible to make the changes to the translation that are necessary so that it communicates what it should in the best way. So they will revise the translation many, many times.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Typists</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIf the translators themselves are not inputting the translation draft into a computer or tablet, then someone else on the team needs to do this. This needs to be someone who can type without making a lot of errors. This person also needs to know how to use punctuation marks correctly and consistently. This person may also need to type the revisions and corrections to the translation after each round of checking.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Translation Testers</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSome people need to test the translation with members of the language community to make sure that the translation is clear and sounds natural in the target language. Usually these are the translators, but they could be other people. These testers need to read the translation to people and then ask them questions to see how they are understanding it. For a description of this task, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/language_community_check\" title=\"Language Community Check\">Language Community Check</a>. For alternate methods of testing the translation, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/other_methods\" title=\"Other Methods\">Other Methods</a>. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Checkers</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe people who are selected to check the translation for accuracy should be people who already know the Bible well in the source language. They should be able to read well in the source language. They will be comparing the translation to the source Bible, to make sure that the translation communicates everything that is in the source Bible. They should be people who are interested in the translation work and who have time to do a good job of checking. It is good if these people can include members of the different church groups who speak the target language and who will use the translation. The level 2 checkers should be leaders in their local church. The level 3 checkers should be leaders of groups of churches, or respected very widely in the language area. Since many of these people are very busy, it may work best to send different books or chapters to different people, and not burden one or two people with the whole translation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/qualifications\" title=\"Translator Qualifications\">Translator Qualifications</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_source_text\" title=\"Choosing a Source Text\">Choosing a Source Text</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_alphabet\" title=\"Alphabet/Orthography\">Alphabet/Orthography</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/writing_decisions\" title=\"Decisions for Writing Your Language\">Decisions for Writing Your Language</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

It was intentionally created for easy translation; many of the difficult theological and linguistic parts were greatly simplified in order to help the translators. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe recommend that you begin by translating Open Bible Stories. There are many good reasons to start by translating Open Bible Stories:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> Open Bible Stories was designed to be easily translated</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> It is largely narrative</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Many difficult phrases and words have been substituted with words that are easier to translate</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> It has many pictures to help the translator understand the text</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Open Bible Stories is much shorter than the Bible or even the New Testament, so it can be quickly completed and distributed to the Church</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Since it is not Scripture, Open Bible Stories removes the fear that many translators have of translating the Word of God</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Translating Open Bible Stories before translating the Bible gives the translators experience and training in translation, so that when they translate the </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Bible, they will do it well\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Experience in creating a translation and checking team</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Experience in doing the translation and checking process</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Experience in using the unfoldingWord translation tools</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Experience in resolving translation conflicts</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Experience in getting church and community participation</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Experience in publishing and distributing content</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Open Bible Stories is a great tool to teach the church, evangelize the lost, and train the translators in what the Bible is all about</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou can work your way through the Stories in whatever order that you want, but we have found Story #31 (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/obs/31\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/obs/31\">https://door43.org/en/obs/31</a> ) is a good first story to translate since it is short and easy to understand.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Conclusion</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nUltimately, the church needs to decide what they want to translate, and in what order. But because translation is a skill that improves with use, and because the translation and checking teams can learn so much about translating the Bible by translating Open Bible Stories, and because of the immense value that the translated Open Bible Stories gives to the local church, we highly recommend starting your translation project with Open Bible Stories. \n</p>\n<p>\nAfter translating Open Bible Stories, we recommend working through some of the Difficulty Level 2 and 3 books (like Ruth and Mark). Finally, after the translation team has a lot of experience, then they can start translating Difficulty Level 4 and 5 books (like John, Hebrews, and Psalms). If the translation team follows this schedule, they will make better translations with far fewer mistakes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Credits: “Translation Difficulty” taken from Biblecode.doc, © SIL International.

First, if you translate from a copyrighted work without prior permission you are breaking the law because translation is a right reserved for the owner of the content. In some places, copyright infringement is a criminal offense and may be prosecuted by the government without the copyright holder's consent! Second, when a translation is done off of a copyrighted work, the translation is the intellectual property of the copyright holder of the source text. They maintain all the rights of the translation just as they do with the source text. For these and other reasons, unfoldingWord will only distribute translations that are not in violation of copyright law.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >What License Do We Use?</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAll content published by unfoldingWord is released under a <strong>Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License (CC BY-SA)</strong> (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a> ). We believe this license is the greatest help to the church because it is permissive enough to allow translation and other derivatives to be made from it, but not so permissive that those derivatives can be locked up under restrictive licenses.

It is important because translations (and source texts) can change frequently. Being able to identify each version helps bring clarity about which iteration is being talked about. Version numbers are also important because all translations should be based off of the latest source text. If the source text changes, the translation should be updated to match the latest version. \n</p>\n<p>\nBefore starting a translation project, please ensure that you have the latest version of the source text.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >How Versioning Works</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nVersion numbers are only given when a work is published, not when they are edited (in Door43 or translationStudio). Edit revision is kept in Door43, but this is different than a work being given a version number.\n</p>\n<p>\nPrior to August 1, 2015, the versioning system used by unfoldingWord was very complex. Each major revision would increase the version number by 0.1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 1.1) while each minor revision would change it by 0.0.1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 1.0.1). When translations were created based off of a version number, it became widely complex to keep track of what translation was based off of which version. \n</p>\n<p>\nOn August 1, 2015, a new versioning system was adopted. Each source text was given an integer (e.g. ver 1). Any edits made to the source text increased the integer by 1 (e.g. ver 1 became ver 2). Any translations based off of that source text took the version number the translation was based off of and added .1 (e.g. a translation off of ver 2 would be published as ver 2.1). A translation off of that translation would add a .1 to the version number it was created from (e.g. a translation off of ver 2.1 would be published as 2.1.1). Any time a text was updated, the number associated with that text would increase by 1 (e.g. if ver 2.1.1 was updated, it would become ver 2.1.2; ver 2.1 would become ver 2.2; etc). For a complete explanation of unfoldingWord versioning please read <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://unfoldingword.org/versioning\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://unfoldingword.org/versioning\">https://unfoldingword.org/versioning</a> .\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Note: For Open Bible Stories, all translations ver 3.x and before are the old system, ver 4 and above are the new system.</em>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Where to Find the Latest Version</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\n<a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://unfoldingword.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://unfoldingword.org\">https://unfoldingword.org</a> always has the latest published version of each resource. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Note: translationStudio and the unfoldingWord app do not always have the latest versions since updating content does not happen automatically.</em>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >How to Update a Previous Version of Open Bible Stories</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n</div>\n<h4 >Identify which Version of Open Bible Stories</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nMany translations have the version number listed. If the version number is not available, figuring out which version a translation was based off of is important. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo figure out which version a particular translation was translated from, do the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Check story #45. If it ends with Philip looking at the chariot, then it is translated from version 1.x. If it ends with the Ethiopian Official smiling, go to the next step.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Check frame 06-02. If the phrase “to the land where Abraham's relatives lived” is not included, then it is translated from version 2.x. If it is included, it is translated from at least version 3.x. (Also check frame 09-06. If “in order to save him from being killed” is not included, it is translated from version 2.x. If it is included, it is translated from at least version 3.x.)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If you are still not sure, we have created a complete set of all the changes between Version 1.x (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html\">https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_1-to-ver_3.html</a> ) or Version 2.x (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html\">https://door43.org/obs-diffs/ver_2-to-ver_3.html</a> ) and the current version.

There are many things to think about when creating an alphabet, and creating a good one can be very difficult. If this seems to be too difficult, you could do an audio translation instead of a written one.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe goal of a good alphabet is to have one letter to represent each different sound of your language.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf a neighboring language already has an alphabet, and if that language has similar sounds to your language, it might work well to simply borrow their alphabet. If not, then the next best thing is to borrow the alphabet from the national language that you learned in school. However, it is likely that your language has sounds that the national language does not, and so it will be difficult to use this alphabet to represent all of the sounds of your language. In that case, it is good to think about each sound in your language. Write out the national language alphabet on a piece of paper from top to bottom. Then write a word from your language next to each letter that either starts with that sound or has that sound in it. Underline the letter that makes that sound in each of the words. There may be letters in the national alphabet that your language does not use. That is fine. Now think about the sounds from these words that you had a hard time writing, or that you could not find a letter for. If the sound is similar to a sound that you did find a letter for, then maybe you can modify that letter to represent the other sound. For example, if you have a sound represented by “s”, and a similar sound that there was no letter for, you could add a mark to the letter for the similar sound, such as putting ' or ^ or ~ on top of it. If you find that there is a group of sounds that seem to all have the same kind of difference from the national language sounds, then it is good to modify that group of letters in the same way. \n</p>\n<p>\nOnce you have finished this exercise and cannot think of any more sounds in your language, try writing a story or write down something that happened recently. As you write, you will probably discover sounds that you had not thought of earlier. Continue to modify letters so that you can write these sounds. Add these sounds to the list you made earlier.\n</p>\n<p>\nTake your list of sounds to other speakers of your language who also read the national language and see what they think about it. Maybe they can suggest a different way to modify some letters that is simpler or easier to read. Also show these other people the story you wrote and teach them to read it by referring to your list of words and letter-sounds. If they can learn to read it easily, then your alphabet is good. If it is difficult, then there might be parts of the alphabet that still need work to be simpler, or there may be different sounds that are being represented by the same letter, or there may be some sounds that you still need to find letters for.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is good to continue to work on this alphabet together with other speakers of your language who are good readers in the national language. You can discuss the different sounds and decide on the best way to represent them together. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf the national language uses a writing system other than the Roman alphabet, then think about the different marks that you could use to modify the symbols so that they can represent the sounds of your language. It is best if you can mark the symbols in ways that can be reproduced on a computer. You can experiment with the writing systems in MS Word or with the keyboards in translationStudio. If you need help creating a keyboard for translationStudio, send an email request to help@door43.org. When you use symbols that can be typed on a computer keyboard, then your translation can be stored, copied, and distributed electronically, and then people can get it for no cost and read it on tablets or cell phones.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/writing_decisions\" title=\"Decisions for Writing Your Language\">Decisions for Writing Your Language</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

From creating alphabets, typing, typesetting, formatting, publishing, and distributing, there are many technical aspects to translation. In order to make all this possible, there are some standards that have been adopted. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >USFM: Bible Translation Format</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nFor many years, the de facto standard format for Bible translation has been USFM (which stands for Unified Standard Format Markers). We have adopted this standard as well. \n</p>\n<p>\nUSFM is a type of markup language that tells a computer program how to format the text. For instance, each chapter is marked like this <code>\\c 1</code> or <code>\\c 33</code>. Verse markers might look like <code>\\v 8</code> or <code>\\v 14</code>. Paragraphs are marked <code>\\p</code>. There are many other markers like this that have specific meaning. So a passage like John 1:1-3 in USFM will look like this: \n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">\\s5\n\\c 1\n\\p\n\\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\n\\v 2 This one, the Word, was in the beginning with God.\n\\v 3 All things were made through him, and without him there was not one thing made that has been made.</pre>\n<p>\nWhen a computer program that can read USFM sees this, it is able to format all of the chapter markers the same way (for instance, with a larger number) and all the verse numbers the same way (for instance, with a small superscript number). \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong><em>Bible translations must be in USFM for us to be able to use it!</em></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nTo read more about USFM notation please read <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://paratext.org/about/usfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://paratext.org/about/usfm\">http://paratext.org/about/usfm</a> .\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >How To Do a Bible Translation in USFM</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nMost people do not know how to write in USFM. This is a huge reason why we created translationStudio. If you do a Bible translation in translationStudio what you see looks very similar to a normal word processor document without any markup language. But what translationStudio is doing underneath what you see, is formatting the Bible translation into USFM. This way, when you upload your translation from translationStudio, what is being uploaded is already formatted in USFM and can be immediately used on the unfoldingWord website and mobile app.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Converting a Translation to USFM</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThough it is strongly encouraged to only do a translation using USFM notation, sometimes a translation is done without using USFM markup. This type of translation still can be used, but first the USFM markers must be added. The simplest way to do this is to copy and paste it into translationStudio, then place the verse markers in the correct place. When this is done, the translation will be able to be exported as USFM. This is a very arduous task, so we strongly recommend doing your Bible translation work from the beginning in translationStudio or some other program that uses USFM. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Format for Biblical Content</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAt the time of writing, Door43 is in the middle of a transition from DokuWiki formatting to Markdown formatting. For the foreseeable future, both markup styles will be accepted with Markdown being the preferred format.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >DokuWiki</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nDokuWiki is a markup language. As a markup language, it uses symbols and codes to represent formatting. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor instance, “DokuWiki supports <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, and <em class=\"u\">underlined</em>.” But that is written\n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">DokuWiki supports **bold**, //italic//, and __underlined__.</pre>\n<p>\nDokuWiki also supports headings. Headings are written like this:  \n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">===== Heading 1 =====\n==== Heading 2 ====\n=== Heading 3 === </pre>\n<p>\nDokuWiki also supports links. An external link displays like this <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org\">https://door43.org</a> but is written like this:\n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">https://door43.org</pre>\n<p>\nAn internal link automatically pulls in the title of a page and displays it as a clickable link like this “<a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta\" title=\"Welcome to translationAcademy\">Welcome to translationAcademy</a>” but is written like this: \n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">[[en:ta]]</pre>\n<p>\nAn internal link can also be customized so that the user can display something other than the title of the page like “<a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta\" title=\"this\">this</a>”. It is written like this: \n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">[[en:ta|this]]</pre>\n<p>\nBy using DokuWiki markup, it makes it very easy for the same formatting to appear in a webpage, on a mobile app, and in a PDF. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor a complete listing of DokuWiki notation please visit <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/syntax\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/syntax\">https://door43.org/en/syntax</a>\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Markdown</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nMarkdown is a very common markup language. It also uses symbols like DokuWiki does, but the symbols are a little different. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor instance, “Markdown supports <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>.” But that is written\n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">Markdown supports **bold** and *italic*.</pre>\n<p>\nMarkdown also supports headings. Headings are written like this:  \n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\"># Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3</pre>\n<p>\nMarkdown also supports links. Links display like this <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://unfoldingword.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://unfoldingword.org\">https://unfoldingword.org</a> and are written like this:\n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">https://unfoldingword.org</pre>\n<p>\nCustomized wording for links are also supported, like “<a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta\" title=\"this\">this</a>”. It is written like this:\n</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">[this](https://unfoldingword.org)</pre>\n<p>\nBy using Markdown, it makes it very easy for the same formatting to appear in a webpage, on a mobile app, and in a PDF. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Note: <abbr title=\"HyperText Markup Language\">HTML</abbr> is valid in Markdown.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor a complete listing of Markdown notation please visit <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</a> .\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Conclusion</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe easiest way to get content marked up with USFM, DokuWiki, or Markdown is by using an editor that is specifically designed to do that. If a word processor or a text editor is used, these markings must be manually entered. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Note: Making text bold, italic, or underlined in a word processor does not make it bold, italic, or underlined in a markup language. This type of formatting must be done by writing the designated symbols.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen contemplating which software to use, please keep in mind that translation is not just about words; there are a lot of technical aspects that need to be taken into consideration. Whatever software is used, just remember that Bible translations need to be put into USFM, and everything else needs to be put either into DokuWiki or Markdown formatting. \n</p>\n</div>"

The steps are designed to work together in sequence so that, when a translator follows them carefully, the outcome will be a draft of Scripture text that speaks naturally in the target language, and has been checked by several people to make sure that it communicates everything that the source text communicated.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Methodology Steps in MAST</h2>\n<div class=\"level2\">\n<p>\nMAST methodology is comprised of eight steps. The first four describe the Drafting Steps and the last four describe the Checking Steps. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Drafting Steps</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Consume</strong> - Take in the source text, usually one chapter at a time for scripture translation. For a written translation, the translator would read the chapter, and for an oral translation the translator would listen to the chapter. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Verbalize</strong> - Express what you just consumed to someone else. Tell this other person what the chapter is about. It is best if you can do this in the target language. This should not be a detailed discussion of the text in exegetical form. This should largely focus on the expression of the main points of the chapter.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Chunk</strong> - Group the text of the chapter into sections. These sentences in each section should fit together because of a shared topic, theme, of chain of logic. The sections should be bigger than sentences or verses,  often 2, 3, or 4 verses at a time. If you are translating in translationStudio from the ULB and UDB texts, you do not need to do this step because the chunking has been done for you. But if you would like to make different chunks than the ULB and UDB have, then go ahead and do so.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Blind Draft</strong> - Set aside the source text and draft the chunk as well as you can without looking back at the text. Write everything that you remember about that chunk. Do not look back at the source text for this chunk until you begin the editing steps. Continue doing this with each chunk of the chapter before moving to the checking steps.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Checking Steps</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Self edit</strong> - The translator can now examine their newly drafted scripture chunks and compare them to the source text(s). Any error can be edited and corrected at this point, The key focus question at this step is, “What did I miss?” Anything that was missed in blind drafting should be added into the translation now, in the place where it is most natural in the target language.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Peer edit</strong> - When the translator has finished the self-edit step for the whole chapter, they should trade it for a chapter that another translator has finished self-editing. The translators will examine each other's chapter, looking for anything that seems unnatural as well as anything that seems to be inaccurate. When they find a problem, they should mark it and then discuss the problems and fix them together.  </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Keyword Check</strong> - a facilitator, working with the translator, should examine each new drafted chapter for all key words in two steps:</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> A. The facilitator should ask if each key word is present in the newly translated scripture. If it is not, then it either needs to be added or there needs to be a good reason why it is not, such as the meaning being communicated by a different word or words.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> B. The facilitator should ask the translator to provide a definition of each key word in the text and compare it to an already developed list of contextual definitions. These definitions should match. If they do not, the translation team needs to discuss which word is the best to use for the key term in this context. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Verse-by-Verse Check</strong> - a facilitator should examine each verse of the newly translated chapter and compare it to the source text to make sure that it accurately communicates the same message as the source and to verify with the translator that the verses flow naturally in the target language.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nFor more information about these steps, see the modules in the list below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/qualifications\" title=\"Translator Qualifications\">Translator Qualifications</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_source_text\" title=\"Choosing a Source Text\">Choosing a Source Text</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/first_draft\" title=\"Make a First Draft\">Make a First Draft</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/self_check\" title=\"Self Check\">Self Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/peer_check\" title=\"Peer Check\">Peer Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/important_term_check\" title=\"translationWord Check\">translationWord Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/accuracy_check\" title=\"Accuracy Check\">Accuracy Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

In English, the ULB text is in bold.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are many different type of notes in the translationNotes. You should read all of the translationNotes for a frame or chunk of text before starting to translate it. You should also read both the ULB and the UDB and the definitions of the translationWords.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Types of translationNotes</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n</div>\n<h4 >Definitions</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nOne type of translationNote is the definition of a word. If a word in the ULB seems special or unusual, but not important enough to be included in the translationWords, the translationNotes will have the meaning of the word. Simple definitions of words or phrases are added without quotes or sentence format. Here are examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>marketplace</strong>  - a large, open-air area where people would come to sell their goods</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>flute</strong>  - a long, hollow musical instrument which is played by blowing air in or over one end</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>kings' palaces</strong>  - a large, expensive house that a king lives in</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Explanations</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSimple explanations about words or phrases are in sentence format. For example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>washing their nets</strong>  - They were cleaning their fishing nets in order to use them again to catch fish.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>motioned</strong> - They were too far from shore to call so they made gestures, probably waving their arms.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Suggested Translations</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nAnother type of translationNote is to give you suggestions for different ways you could translate the same meaning. There are several types of suggested translations. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h5 >Direct Replacements</h5>\n<div class=\"level5\">\n<p>\nSynonyms or equivalent phrases are written in double-quotes. These can replace the text in the ULB. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn this example, the words “the path” or the words “the road” can  replace the words “the way” in the ULB. You can then decide if it is more natural to use a word like “path” or “road” or “way” in your language.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>the way</strong>  - “the path” or “the road”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIn this example, the words “do the same thing” can replace the words “do  likewise” in the ULB. You, as the translator, can decide which is more  natural for your language.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>do likewise</strong>  - “do the same thing” </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h5 >Alternate Translation(s)</h5>\n<div class=\"level5\">\n<p>\nAn alternate translation is a suggested change to the form or content of the ULB because the target language may use a different form to communicate the same meaning. \n</p>\n<p>\nExamples include adding implicit information, changing passive voice to active, and stating rhetorical questions as statements.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe letters “AT” stand for “Alternate Translation,” so “AT:” indicates that what follows is an alternate translation that should only be used when the form or content of the ULB is confusing or is not enough to communicate the meaning in your language.  Some examples are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>see the salvation of God</strong>  - AT: “learn about how God saves people from sin.”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Follow me</strong>  - AT: “Be my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Clarifying Translation in the UDB</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThere may be no note if the UDB provides a good alternate translation for the ULB. However, on occasion there may be text from the UDB as well as a suggested translation. In that case, there will be “(UDB)” after the text from the UDB as below:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>implored him</strong>  - “begged him” or “pleaded with him” (UDB)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>he fell on his face</strong>  - “he bowed down to the ground” (UDB) or “he knelt and touched the ground with his face”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Alternate Meaning(s)</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe translationNotes will give <strong>alternate meanings</strong> when there are different ways to understand what a word or phrase means. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis kind of note will start with the words, “Possible meanings  are that,” and then it will number the possible meanings with the preferred or most likely meaning first. If the meaning is given as an explanation, like the following examples, it is not in quotes.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>You are like a young lion … like a monster in the seas</strong> - Possible meanings are that 1) he was like a lion and a monster or 2) he thought he was like a lion, but he was really only a monster.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>like a monster in the seas</strong> - Possible meanings are that 1) he was powerful or 2) he was not doing anything important.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf the meaning is given in a way that can be used as a translation, like the following examples, it is in quotes.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>fell down at Jesus knees</strong> - Possible meanings are 1) “bowed down at Jesus feet” or 2) “lay down  on the ground at Jesus feet” or 3) “knelt down before Jesus.” Peter did not fall accidentally. He did this as a sign of humility and respect for Jesus.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Probable or Possible Meanings</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSometimes Bible scholars do not know for sure, or do not agree on, what a particular phrase or sentence in the Bible means. Some reasons for this include:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> There are minor differences in the ancient Bible texts.  </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> A word may have more than one meaning or use. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It may not be clear what a word (such as a pronoun) refers to in a particular phrase. </div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nSee <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/resources_porp\" title=\"Probable or Possible Meanings\">Probable or Possible Meanings</a> for more information.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Identify Figures of Speech</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe purpose of some translationNotes is to alert you to figures of speech in the ULB and to give ideas for how to translate the same meaning in a different way. Notes that identify and explain a figure of speech will use sentence form and put the meaning in quotes.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Make ready the way of the Lord</strong> - This phrase compares people preparing themselves for the arrival of the Lord to people who are repairing a road for someone to use it. AT: “Repent and be ready for when the Lord comes.” (See: Metaphor)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>You offspring of poisonous snakes</strong> - Jesus uses this expression to emphasize how dangerous the Pharisees are. Poisonous snakes are dangerous and represent evil. AT: “You evil poisonous snakes!” or “You are evil like poisonous snakes.” (See: Metaphor)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf there is a translationAcademy page that explains a certain kind of figure of speech, the note will identify what kind of figure of speech it is in parentheses at the end of the note. For example, (See: Metaphor). You can then look up that kind of figure of speech in translationAcademy for more explanation. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Indirect to Direct Quote</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nWhen a translationNote is giving a direct quote as an alternative translation for an indirect quote, it will say, “This can be translated as a direct quote:” and then it will give a suggestion for how to translate it as a direct quote. For example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>to tell no one</strong> -  This can be translated as a direct quote: “Do not tell anyone.” The implied information is “that you have been healed.” (See: Speech Quotations, Explicit and Implicit Information)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWhenever a translationNote says “See:” in parentheses at the end of the note, the words that follow are topics that you can look up in translationAcademy that will further explain the issue that the translationNote talks about.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Multiple Notes on Long Phrase</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSometimes there are notes for a phrase and also separate notes for portions of that same phrase. In that case, the larger phrase is first, and its parts come afterward. For example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>you say, 'Behold, he is a gluttonous man</strong> - This can be translated as an indirect quote: “you say that he is a  gluttonous man” or “you accuse him of being a gluttonous man.”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>he is a gluttonous man</strong> - “he is a greedy eater” or “he habitually eats too much food”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/resources_links\" title=\"Links in the translationNotes\">Links in the translationNotes</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

This will make it easier for you to translate this phrase by reminding you of where you have already translated it. This will make your translation faster and more consistent because you will be reminded to translate that phrase in the same way each time. If a translation that you have used before for the same phrase does not fit a new context, then you will have to think of a new way to translate it. In this case, you should make a note of it and discuss it with others on the translation team. These links will only take you back to notes in the book that you are working on. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Examples</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>be fruitful and multiply</strong> - See how you translated these commands in Genesis 12:28.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>everything that creeps along the ground</strong> - This includes all types of small animals.

Probable Meaning</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nWhen most scholars generally agree on a meaning, we write a note that includes the word “probably.”  We recommend that you use the meaning that is given in the note.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>The sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying, “Listen to us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us.</strong>  (Genesis 23:5-6) </div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>a prince of God</strong> - This <em class=\"u\">probably</em> means “a powerful man” (UDB) or “a mighty leader.” </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>The angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why do you ask my name?

Possible Meanings</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nWhen many scholars say that a word or phrase means one thing, and many others say that it means other things, we show the most common meanings that they give.

Irony is typically used to be humorous or to place emphasis on how different something is from what it should be, or how far someone's belief is from the truth. Irony makes these points more powerfully than direct statements do. In irony, sometimes a speaker repeats what someone has (or could have) said or thought, but he expects the listeners to understand from the context that he does not agree with it. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If the irony would be understood correctly, translate it as is.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If the irony would not be understood correctly, you could indicate that the thoughts are not truly those of the speaker but of someone else. For example,  In Mark 7:9, Jesus says to the Pharisees, “Rightly you set aside the commandment of God in order to set up your own tradition.” Jesus is putting into words what the Pharisees actually do, even though they would never admit that they do this. Everyone who hears this, including Jesus, knows that it is wrong to set aside a commandment of God. So Jesus is rebuking the Pharisees in a powerful way by using words that seem to commend them for doing wrong. If the irony would not be understood, this could be translated as “You think you have done well in following your traditions. But as you do that, you have rejected God's commandments.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nHaving blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” (Luke 22:64b WEB)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe soldiers were hitting Jesus and they told him to prophecy and say who hit him. This was irony. They were implying that if he were a prophet, he should be able to tell who hit him, but they did not believe that he was a real prophet. They told him to prophecy because they were mocking him and wanted to prove that he was not really a prophet.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the irony would not be understood here, the soldier's words could be translated more directly as, “You are not a prophet - you cannot even tell us who struck you.”\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nWhen Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” (Mark 2:17a WEB)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nWhen Jesus spoke here of righteous people, that was irony. Jesus knew that there are no righteous people. But some people thought that they really were righteous, and they didn't think that Jesus should allow sinners to follow him. But Jesus invited sinners to go to him and turn from their sins. He was not inviting people who think they are righteous and think that they do not need to turn from their sins. Only people who know that they are sinners would repent of their sins.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the irony would not be understood here, part of Mark 2:17 could be translated as “I have not come to call those who think they are righteous to repentance, but those who know they are sinners.”\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Examples from English</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“The used-car salesman told me that this car was a great bargain at only $1000, so I bought it. But now I find out that the radiator doesn't work, and it will cost me $4000 to get it repaired. <em class=\"u\">Great bargain. Yeah, right</em>.”</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nIn this example, the speaker uses irony to express that the reality of the car was totally different than what the car salesman said, so he repeats the car salesman's words, but now mocking them as false.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“Thanks for holding the door open for me.”</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis would be an ironic statement made to someone who did not hold the door open for the speaker. It expresses that the other person should have been kind enough to hold it open, and that the speaker is annoyed with that person for not doing that. The expression of thanks for something that both the hearer and the speaker know that the hearer did not do has become, through irony, a rebuke for not doing it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_litotes\" title=\"Litotes\">Litotes</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Metaphors imply (or state directly) that the two things have something in common. Like simile, this involves a comparison, but the words ‘like’ and ‘as’ are not used to show it. (See <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_simile\" title=\"Simile\">Simile</a>.). A metaphor transfers an image from one familiar object to another object that is less easily understood. \n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, “Life is a journey,” is a metaphor that helps convey a concept about life - that it is like a journey in some way - perhaps because in both you are always moving along and progressing, not staying in the same place. In this example, “life” is the topic, “a journey” is the image that is being applied to the topic, and the concept of movement or progression is the point of similarity. Every metaphor has a topic, an image, and a point of similarity. But as with this example, usually the point of similarity is not stated. Often the author expects the reader or hearer to think about the comparison and see the point of similarity for themselves.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Purposes of Metaphor</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> One purpose of metaphor is to teach about something that is unknown by indicating that it is similar to something that is already known.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Another purpose of metaphor is to emphasize that something has a particular trait or to indicate that it has that particular trait in an extreme way.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Another purpose of metaphor is to lead people to react emotionally to one thing as they would to another.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If the image in the original is unknown to your people, use an image from your own culture.

We don't want to have comparisons to things that had not been invented when the books of the Bible were first written.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Or if the image in the original is unknown to your people, simply state the point of similarity without using an image.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If it would be unclear to your readers how the topic is like the image, you can state the point of similarity clearly. However, do not do this if it was also not clear to the original audience.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If the topic is not stated clearly in the original and it would be unclear to your readers what the topic is, state the topic clearly. However, do not do this if the topic was not clear to the original audience. For example, in Matthew 16:6, Jesus told his disciples “Beware of the <em class=\"u\">yeast</em>  of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” His disciples thought he was talking about bread, but Jesus was warning them about the <em class=\"u\">teaching</em>  of the Pharisees and Sadducees. That was the topic, but it was unstated, and the disciples did not understand it at first. If the metaphor were fully stated, it would be, “The teaching of the Pharisees is like yeast.” the point of similarity is that they both spread throughout whatever they touch and change it.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If the target audience would not understand the metaphor, then change the metaphor to a simile by adding “like” or “as”.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nJesus said to them. “I am the <em class=\"u\">bread of life</em>. He who comes to me will not be hungry, and he who trusts in me will never be thirsty.“  (John 6:35)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nJesus compared himself to bread, a food that people ate all the time then.

(Luke 1:78b-79a)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis verse has several related metaphors. The Savior is compared to the rising sun, teaching spiritual truth is compared to the sun shining, lacking spiritual truth is compared to sitting in darkness, and the fear of death is compared to a shadow.

For example, if a parent wants to scold or rebuke his child for writing on the walls, some languages could do it with different forms of rhetorical questions, such as: “Why are you writing on the wall?” or “Who told you to write on the wall?” or “Is that <em class=\"u\">your</em>  wall that you are writing on?” Other languages would use a statement, such as: “I told you not to write on the walls,” or a command, such as: “Do not write on the walls!” </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If, after determining the purpose of the rhetorical question, you decide that your language would use a statement or a command for that purpose, then use a statement or command instead of a rhetorical question. For example, in Mark 13:2, Jesus says to one of his disciples, “Do you see these great buildings?” (ULB). Jesus knows that the disciple sees them, but he uses a rhetorical question to draw attention to them. If your language would not use a rhetorical question to draw people's attention to something, then use whatever form is natural, such as a command, “Look at these great buildings,” or a statement, “These buildings are very great.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nZechariah said to the angel, “How will I know this will happen?

English speakers can refer to one person as ‘you’ or to many people as ‘you.’ Often the context will make it clear as to whether the word ‘you’ refers to one person or more than one.

This often happens in a letter. \n</p>\n<p>\nAlso watch the video for computer (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/cPtjzJ2Advk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/cPtjzJ2Advk\">http://youtu.be/cPtjzJ2Advk</a> ) or tablet/phone (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/AVITfDEk8nc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/AVITfDEk8nc\">http://youtu.be/AVITfDEk8nc</a> ).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_abstractnouns\" title=\"Abstract Nouns\">Abstract Nouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_activepassive\" title=\"Active or Passive\">Active or Passive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_doublenegatives\" title=\"Double Negatives\">Double Negatives</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_ellipsis\" title=\"Ellipsis\">Ellipsis</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive\" title=\"Exclusive\">Exclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_123person\" title=\"First, Second or Third Person\">First, Second or Third Person</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_you\" title=\"Forms of You\">Forms of You</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_youdual\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural\">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_youformal\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal\">Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_gendernotations\" title=\"Gender Notations\">Gender Notations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_genitivecase\" title=\"Genitive Case\">Genitive Case</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_grammar\" title=\"Grammar Topics\">Grammar Topics</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive\" title=\"Inclusive\">Inclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_singularpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Singular\">Pronouns - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_pluralpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Plural\">Pronouns - Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_rpronouns\" title=\"Reflexive Pronouns\">Reflexive Pronouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_quotations\" title=\"Speech Quotations\">Speech Quotations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_sentences\" title=\"Sentences\">Sentences</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_verbs\" title=\"Verbs\">Verbs</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Sometimes the author wanted to discuss something that happened at an earlier time than the event that he just talked about, or he wants to start talking about one event, then mention earlier events. This can be confusing to the reader.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn some languages this does not cause a problem, but in other languages events are always told in the order in which they occurred. In these languages, readers might misunderstand a story that tells events out of order, or it might seem to them that this translation of the Bible is full of errors. For these languages, the correct thing to do is to put the events in the order in which they happened, or to indicate in some other way that the events are being told in a different order than the order that they normally expect.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nBut then Herod … had John locked up in prison. Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized. (Luke 3:20-21)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis can sound like John baptized Jesus and the people while he was in prison, but it actually happened earlier. \n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nJust as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets… But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout.”  (Joshua 6:8-10)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis sounds like Joshua gave the order not to shout after the army had already started their march, but it actually happened earlier.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nWho is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?  (Revelation 5:2)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis sounds like the person should open the scroll and then break the seals that hold it closed. But the seals that lock the scroll must be broken before the scroll can be unrolled.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Strategies</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nHere are two ways to fix the problems in the verses above.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If your language uses phrases, time words or verb tenses to show that an event happened before the one just mentioned, consider using one of them. (See: <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_verbs\" title=\"Verbs\">Verbs</a>)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If your language prefers to tell events in the order that they occurred, consider reordering the events so they they are in that order. This may require putting two or more verses together (like 5-6). (See: <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_versebridge\" title=\"Verse Bridges\">Verse Bridges</a>)</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Examples of Translation Strategies Applied</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong><sup>20</sup> But then Herod … had John locked up in prison. <sup>21</sup> Now it came about, while all the people were being baptized by John, that Jesus also was baptized.</strong> (Luke 3:20-21)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n1. Using the first strategy, if we add a time phrase to this verse, it can make it clear that the writer is talking about something that happened earlier:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>20</sup> But then Herod … had John locked up in prison. <sup>21</sup> <em class=\"u\">Before John was put in prison,</em> while all the people were being baptized by John, Jesus also was baptized.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n2. We do not recommend the second strategy for this passage, because that would require moving verses 21 and 22 before verse 19. The verse bridge would then include 4 verses (19-22), rather than the normal maximum of 3. Also, this would disturb the flow of the narrative, which moves from being about John in verses 1-20 to being about Jesus from verse 21 onward (that is why the events are told out of order). If you still feel that you should reorder verses in a case like this, discuss it with the translation team and decide together if reordering the verses is worth disturbing the original ordering and the flow of the narrative.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong><sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets…<sup>10</sup> But Joshua commanded the people, saying, “Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout.”</strong>   (Joshua 6:8-10)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n1. Using the first strategy, we can translate with a verb tense that makes it clear that Joshua <strong>had commanded</strong> the people not to shout at an earlier time:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>8</sup> Just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets…<sup>10</sup> But Joshua <em class=\"u\">had commanded</em> the people, saying, “Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n2. Using the second strategy, we can put verse 10 before verse 8, and make a verse bridge of verses 8-10:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>8-10</sup> Joshua commanded the people, saying, “Do not shout. No sound must leave your mouths until the day I tell you to shout. Only then must you shout.” Then just as Joshua had said to the people, the seven priests carried the seven trumpets of rams horns before Yahweh, as they advanced, they gave a blast on the trumpets… </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?</strong> (Revelation 5:2)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n1. Using the first strategy, we can use a time word to show that opening the scroll only happens after breaking the seals:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> “Who is worthy to open the scroll <em class=\"u\">after</em> breaking its seals?”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n2. Using the second strategy, we can put the second phrase about breaking the seals first. There is no verse bridge, because both phrases are within the same verse:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Examples of Different Logical Ordering</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nJust as with the ordering of events, in some languages it is expected that the arrangement of lists or arguments will be presented in a certain way, according to a logical order.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe normal ordering of clauses in Romans 1:24 is like this:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>24</sup>  For “the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles because of you”, just as it has been written.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nBut if in your language causes need to be stated before results (because logically, they come first), then you could reorder this verse like this:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>24</sup>  For just as it has been written, “because of you, the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles.” </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nHere is Mark 6:8-9 in the ULB. This is the original ordering.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>8</sup> and he instructed them to take nothing for their journey but a staff. They should take no bread, no beggar's bag, and no money in their belts, <sup>9</sup> but to wear sandals, and not to wear two tunics.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nthe UDB has reordered this and made a verse bridge out of verses 8 and 9. It did this because in some languages, it might seem contradictory to say that Jesus told his disciples to take nothing but a staff, but then in the next verse to mention that he wanted them to also wear sandals. So the UDB mentions the things they should take first (sandals and a walking stick), then the things that he did not want them to take.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <sup>8-9</sup> He also instructed them to wear sandals and to take along a walking stick when they were traveling. He told them not to take food, nor a bag in which to put supplies, nor any money for their journey. He also did not allow them to take extra clothing.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou may also want to watch the 6 minute video for computer (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/Fp9qgVoTwss\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/Fp9qgVoTwss\">http://youtu.be/Fp9qgVoTwss</a> ) or tablet/phone (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/AljK2GUdXxc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/AljK2GUdXxc\">http://youtu.be/AljK2GUdXxc</a> ).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_background\" title=\"Background Information\">Background Information</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_connectingwords\" title=\"Connecting Words\">Connecting Words</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_newevent\" title=\"Introduction of a New Event\">Introduction of a New Event</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_participants\" title=\"Introduction of New and Old Participants\">Introduction of New and Old Participants</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_poetry\" title=\"Poetry\">Poetry</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_proverbs\" title=\"Proverbs\">Proverbs</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_quotations\" title=\"Quotations\">Quotations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/writing_symlanguage\" title=\"Symbolic Language\">Symbolic Language</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Both subjects and objects are usually nouns (i.e. a person, place, thing, or idea). Verbs show action or a “state of being.”\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The subject (which will be a noun: a person, place, thing, or idea) is usually  the main “actor” in a sentence.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The “actor” or subject usually does some action or is being described in some way.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWhen the subject is identified, determine what it is doing (or what is happening to it).\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> A subject may be active: it can <strong>perform</strong> or <strong>do</strong> something such as “sing,” or “work,” or “teach.”  </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> A subject can be in a <strong>state</strong> such as “happy,” “sad,” or “mad.”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> Or a subject may have something done to it.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> For example, “The ball was thrown.” (The ball is the subject.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe object of a sentence is a recipient (that is NOT the subject).  The object will also be a person, place, thing, or idea.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn a simple sentence the subject usually does something to or towards an object. Consider the sentence:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“The boy kicked the ball.”</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe boy is the <strong>subject</strong>; the recipient or <strong>object</strong> is the ball.  The subject (boy) does some <strong>action</strong> (kicked) to the object (ball).The VERB tells what the action is that the subject is doing (or being). \n</p>\n<p>\nOften it is easy to find the verb, because one looks for the action occurring in the sentence.  \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAll languages have a preferred word order. Translate sentences so that they are accurate and have a smooth flow.\n</p>\n<p>\nWord order or patterns can vary if the sentence:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> is a question</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> has descriptive words</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> has a place in it</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> has time in it</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> has a condition in it, such as the word “if”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> is a poem</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSometimes the word order will also vary if there is a special type of emphasis. For example, perhaps in your language there is a special way to ask a rhetorical question or give a command. Knowing the preferred word order of the source text and how it is different than the target language can help a translator in translating from that language into the target language. This is especially true if your language does not have the same pattern. If the two languages have a different preferred word order for communicating the same things, then you will need to rephrase the sentence into the order that is preferred in the target language in order to make your translation sound natural. The translator’s goal is always to use natural language to make the meaning clear.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Language Examples</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nNow we will look at the importance of word order.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >English</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIn English, “The boy kicked the ball”. “The boy” is the subject, “kicked” is the verb, and “the ball” is the object.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is the basic word order that English uses to communicate statements. First we say the subject, then the verb, and then the object. We can represent the Subject, Verb and Object with the letters “S”, “V” and “O”.

Only by doing this will the translation be natural and clear.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso view the video for computer (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/PzMpNyCNlLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/PzMpNyCNlLQ\">http://youtu.be/PzMpNyCNlLQ</a> ) or portable device (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/jxeGp2-TuZg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/jxeGp2-TuZg\">http://youtu.be/jxeGp2-TuZg</a> ).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_abstractnouns\" title=\"Abstract Nouns\">Abstract Nouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_activepassive\" title=\"Active or Passive\">Active or Passive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_doublenegatives\" title=\"Double Negatives\">Double Negatives</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_ellipsis\" title=\"Ellipsis\">Ellipsis</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive\" title=\"Exclusive\">Exclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_123person\" title=\"First, Second or Third Person\">First, Second or Third Person</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_you\" title=\"Forms of You\">Forms of You</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_youdual\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural\">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_yousingular\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Singular\">Forms of 'You' - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_youformal\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal\">Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_gendernotations\" title=\"Gender Notations\">Gender Notations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_genitivecase\" title=\"Genitive Case\">Genitive Case</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_grammar\" title=\"Grammar Topics\">Grammar Topics</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive\" title=\"Inclusive\">Inclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_singularpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Singular\">Pronouns - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_pluralpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Plural\">Pronouns - Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_rpronouns\" title=\"Reflexive Pronouns\">Reflexive Pronouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_quotations\" title=\"Speech Quotations\">Speech Quotations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_sentences\" title=\"Sentences\">Sentences</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_verbs\" title=\"Verbs\">Verbs</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

If you do not know what the source word means, the translationNotes and translationWords pages will help you understand its meaning. Sometimes, however, a word in the source text is an object, animal, practice, or other thing that is not known to the people who speak the target language. The following information will help with translating these unknown things or concepts.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Historical facts</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIt is very important to remember that if the term expresses a historical fact, then that fact must be kept in a translation. For example, in Mark 11:13, Jesus cursed a fig tree. To substitute any other kind of tree would be untrue to a historical fact. To translate this, follow one of the following options:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a general descriptive phrase, such as “a fruit tree.”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a descriptive phrase with a borrowed word, such as “a tree that bears fruit called 'figs.'”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a borrowed word for the name of the tree: “a fig tree.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nFor the last two choices, a footnote would be necessary to explain what “fig” means.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother example is In John 12:14-15 where it says that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey's colt, which fulfilled a prophecy in the the Old Testament. Since it says that Jesus was sitting on a donkey's colt, which is a young donkey, the translation should not say that he sat on an ox, for example. If the word for “donkey” does not exist in the target language, a borrowed word could be used and explained in the text or in a footnote. For example, the text could say, “riding on the young of a kind of work animal called a ‘donkey.'”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is different from the use of an animal as part of a teaching or illustration. In that case, it is not a matter of historical fact. See the example of “wolf” below.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Food and other objects</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> plow (vs hand planting)</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level3\"><div class=\"li\"> See the example of translating 'plow' in Luke 9:62, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/bible/notes/luk/09/61\" title=\"Luke 09:61-62\">Luke 09:61-62</a>.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> grapes, vineyard</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> wheat</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> bread</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> numbers, numerals</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h4 >Animals</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nAn example of the use of an animal in the Bible as an illustration is in John 10:12 where the word “wolf” is used as a way to describe a person who is harmful to God's people. There are many things to describe about a wolf but what is important in this verse is that it is a fierce and dangerous animal that frightens and harms the sheep.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf a wolf is an unknown animal in your culture, you could substitute an animal that looks similar and that has similar characteristics. For example, large wild dogs are similar to wolves. They attack and eat other animals, such as lambs. So “wolves” could be translated with a generic term like “wild dogs” or “fierce dogs” or with the name of a specific animal like a dog that your people know of, such as “coyotes” or “jackals.” You could also use a general descriptive phrase such as, “a dangerous wild animal” that focuses on the characteristics that are being highlighted in the text.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso see the translationNote at Luke 10:3 for other translation suggestions for wolf.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Cultural practices</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThere might be many differences between the biblical culture and the target language culture. Sometimes a cultural substitute can be used. But be careful not to change any historical facts (see explanation above).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe unknown biblical practice could be explained in a footnote or Bible teaching. The explanations could include a known cultural practice that has the same meaning as the one described in the Bible text. For example, in Jewish culture, grief and repentance for sin were shown by wearing a rough type of cloth (sackcloth) and putting ashes on the head. Wailing was another sign of grief. In other cultures grief may be shown in different ways. But if this practice was something that actually happened it needs to be recorded as such, with an explanation that tells what it means, perhaps using a practice from the target culture that has the same meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, in certain cultures when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or both cheeks. This can be translated as “to greet him with a kiss” or “to greet him by kissing him.” If this is not done in your culture, you could explain it with a footnote. If your readers would find it embarrassing or inappropriate to say that a man would kiss another man, you could translate it in a more general way such as, “to give him a friendly greeting.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSee the example of 'greet with a kiss' in Luke 22:47, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/bible/notes/luk/22/47\" title=\"Luke 22:47-48\">Luke 22:47-48</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nHere are suggestions to keep in mind when translating a term that is not familiar in your language:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a descriptive phrase. You will most likely need to use a phrase to explain the meaning of the unknown word. It is important only to describe the part of the meaning which is being used in the particular verse being translated.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Substitute something similar. At times the exact word may be unknown to the people of the target language but there might be something similar that could be used in its place. Only do this if the term does not express a historical fact.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a foreign word from another language. Foreign words are words taken from a language that is not the target language. You could also use the foreign word together with a general word or descriptive phrase.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a word that is more general in meaning. An example would be “work animal” which is more general than the word “donkey.” This is acceptable because a donkey is a kind of work animal.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use a word or phrase that is more specific in meaning. Sometimes there is no general word in the target language to describe the term, therefore you can give specific examples of the term being referred to. An example would be if there is no word for “lights” to refer to heavenly bodies, you could possibly say, “the sun, the moon, and the stars,” using specific words.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_names\" title=\"Translate Names\">Translate Names</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_transliterate\" title=\"Copy or Borrow Words\">Copy or Borrow Words</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Understanding this difference will help you as you watch the video (see link below). Within the Bible you will hear many proper names which might be unknown to the reader. It could be unclear what the name is referring to. A Proper Name could refer to a person, a country, a certain landform, a body of water, or something else.

Discuss these with the translation team, and choose one:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Copy the proper name from the source language into the target language with no change. Often, this means using the name as it is spelled in the national language translation.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use the name from the source language, but make adjustments to the spelling or add whatever is necessary so that it sounds like the right kind of name in the target language.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Pronounce the name as it is pronounced in the source language, and using the target language's spelling system, write the name in a way that people will read it with the source language's pronunciation.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf a person or place has two names, follow one of these two ways. In either case, it may be necessary to add a footnote that explains that the two names refer to the same person or place:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use the name that occurs in the particular text you are translating.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Use one name most of the time and the other name only when the text talks about that name or the meaning of that name.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write a careful account for you, most honorable Theophilus.”  (Luke 1:3)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe word “honorable” describes a person.

One is called <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> and the other is called <em><strong>implicit</strong></em>. When a speaker, or writer, has a message to give, he has a particular audience in mind as he gives the message. This affects the form of his message and his decision on what information to include or leave out.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Information that the speaker states clearly is called <strong><em>explicit</em></strong> information. This is the information that the speaker or writer has decided to include in what he says.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Information that the speaker does not state clearly is called <em><strong>implicit</strong></em> information. This is the information that the speaker or writer expects his audience to already know, and so he knows that he does not need to include that information in what he writes.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWhen a writer writes, he has in mind a certain audience who will read what he writes. The writer has a good idea of what this audience does and does not know about what he is writing about, and so the writer chooses to include the important information that he knows his audience does not know. He chooses to not include the information that his audience already knows. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAlthough implicit information is not stated in words but is only implied, it is information that the hearer or reader needs to know if he is to understand the meaning of the message. The speaker or writer has succeeded in communicating his message only if the hearer or reader correctly understands what was clearly stated as well as what was implied.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we translate the Bible, we are making it available to a new audience. This new audience will know some things about what is in the Bible, but often they will not know some of the implicit information that the original writer left out because his original audience already knew it. The new target audience, then, will need to know some of that implicit information in order to understand some parts of the text. So in order for the Bible to communicate its message successfully, the translator needs to include some of the information that the original writer left as implicit for the original audience. If this information can be included in just a few words, then the translator may decide to include this information in the text of the translation. But if it will take more than a few words, it is best to include this information in a footnote. The translator will need to think about his target audience and decide when to include some of this implicit information. Checking the translation with the community is a good way for the translator to find out where he needs to include some implicit information so that they can understand the translation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_explicitinfo\" title=\"Making Implicit Information Explicit\">Making Implicit Information Explicit</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_metaphor\" title=\"Metaphor\">Metaphor</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_simile\" title=\"Simile\">Simile</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_rquestion\" title=\"Rhetorical Question\">Rhetorical Question</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_idiom\" title=\"Idiom\">Idiom</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_irony\" title=\"Irony\">Irony</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_123person\" title=\"First, Second or Third Person\">First, Second or Third Person</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_you\" title=\"Forms of You\">Forms of You</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_youdual\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural\">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_yousingular\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Singular\">Forms of 'You' - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_hypo\" title=\"Hypothetical Situations\">Hypothetical Situations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_events\" title=\"Order of Events\">Order of Events</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_parables\" title=\"Parables\">Parables</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

When we translate a message, such as the Bible, for a new audience, they may not know some of that information that the original writer did not say. That is the implicit information. Because the author is counting on the audience knowing this implicit information, this information is also part of the message, even though it is not stated. So in the places where the target audience needs to know the implicit information in order to understand the text, and they do not know it, you must put it in the translation, either in the text or in a footnote.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut translators need to be particularly sensitive when thinking about adding such information to the translation that is not stated explicitly in the source text because:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Sometimes there will be things that are intentionally unclear in the text.

The translation should always have the same meaning as the source text had for its original audience, not more meaning, not less meaning, and not different meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\nImplicit information may be made explicit in order to make the translation clear if:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Only the implicit information that the original audience would have known is made explicit,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> the added information is necessary so that the target audience will understand the main point of the message,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The translation would communicate no meaning or a wrong meaning without the added information,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> No new information is added that is not part of the original message (do not add something just because you read it in a commentary),</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> the added information does not change the meaning, making it no longer true or accurate,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> the added information is suitable to the original situation in which the message was given.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAs always, you need to ask yourself if your translation is communicating accurately and clearly what the original message was saying.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nShe ate all that she wanted and had some left over.  (Ruth 2:14)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nSome languages may need to add an object where English (or whatever source language is being used) doesn't have one. Here, the implied object is “roasted grain” or simply “food.” If the target language requires an object for these verbs, you could translate,  <em>She ate all <em class=\"u\">the roasted grain</em> that she wanted and had some <em class=\"u\">food</em> left over.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nSo Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.  (Genesis 11:5)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe phrase “came down” refers to <strong>where</strong> he came from. The place he came from was understood by the original readers. But if this sentence is unclear for the target audience, you may name the place to make the information explicit as in: <em>So Yahweh came down <em class=\"u\">from heaven</em> to see the city and the tower which the descendants of Adam had built.</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nThese latter five kings joined together in the valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea).  (Genesis 14:3)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe information that the armies of the five kings were with these five kings was understood by the original readers. But if this information is not understood by the target audience, the information that their armies were with them can be made explicit: “These latter five kings <em class=\"u\">and their armies</em> joined together….” \n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nTo Enoch was born Irad. Irad became the father of Mehujael.  (Genesis 4:18)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nIt is stated explicitly that Enoch had a child named Irad and that Irad had a child named Mehujael. The implied information is that Irad grew up to be a man and married a woman and through her, had a son. If the verse is confusing without this information for the target audience, you may add as much information as is necessary, such as, “Enoch grew up and married and became the father of a son whom he named Irad.

A hypothetical situation is a possible scenario from any point in time: past, present or future. A hypothetical situation in the past did not happen, but could have happened under different circumstances. A hypothetical situation in the present or future may or may not actually happen - the speaker presents it as hypothetical because he does not know or it depends on the actions of others. It could possibly happen or it may never happen. A hypothetical situation might mean asking a “what if” question. It might be a “suppose” or “if only” statement. Hypothetical situations are good teaching tools. Jesus often used them in his teaching.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> How would your language express a situation that could never happen?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> How would you communicate a “suppose” scenario that could happen right now?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> How would your language express a situation that may or may not happen in the future?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Does your language have a special way of indicating a hypothetical situation in the past?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> How does your language express an “if only” or “I wish” scenario which also implies some emotion?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIt is important in translation to be able to recognize a hypothetical situation in the text and use appropriate words or phrases. You may need to show the timing of the hypothetical situation (e.g. past, present or future). You may need to clarify that the scenario is only a possibility: that it might be true or not likely to be true; that it could possibly happen or would never happen.  Hypothetical situations may or may not imply emotions or reasons. Some hypothetical statements may use expressions such as “what if”, “suppose” or “if only” to help the reader understand the type of hypothetical situation.  Perhaps your language uses special wording or specific language structures to communicate each of these things.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\n1. Consider a hypothetical situation that <strong>would never happen</strong>:\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Luke chapter 18 verse 25 Jesus was teaching his disciples about how being rich can make it hard to enter God’s kingdom. To emphasize this, he said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to submit to God’s rule in their life.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hypothetical part of this is that a large camel could never squeeze through the eye of a very small sewing needle! Jesus used this hypothetical scenario to emphasize his teaching point.\n</p>\n<p>\n2. Consider a “suppose” scenario that <strong>could possibly happen</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Matthew chapter 12 verse 11, Jesus was pointing out to the religious leaders that they were not being honest when they judged people for working on the Sabbath day. He told them, “Suppose one of you has a sheep and it falls into a deep hole on the Sabbath day. Certainly, you would work to pull it out of the hole!”\n</p>\n<p>\nJesus wasn’t talking about a specific person who did this. Rather, he was talking about a possible situation which could and often did happen. He used the hypothetical story to help listeners understand his own work (God's work).\n</p>\n<p>\n3. The following is an example of a hypothetical scenario <strong>in the past</strong>:\n</p>\n<p>\nIn Matthew 11:21, Jesus said that <em>if the people living in the ancient cities of Tyre and Sidon had been able to see the miracles that he – Jesus – performed, they would have repented long ago.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a hypothetical situation that we know did not happen. Jesus was making the spiritual teaching point of “what if” these people had seen the miracles? If they had seen the miracles, then, they would have repented.\n</p>\n<p>\n4. Often a hypothetical situation in the past <strong>expresses an emotion, such as regret</strong>. For example, consider Exodus 16:3:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt….”</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nHere the Israelites are afraid that they will have to suffer and die of hunger in the wilderness, and so they are wishing that they had stayed in Egypt and died there with full stomachs.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso watch the video for computer (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/GfFX1wWjJhA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/GfFX1wWjJhA\">http://youtu.be/GfFX1wWjJhA</a> ) or tablet/phone (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"http://youtu.be/jIbY2ikNtHU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youtu.be/jIbY2ikNtHU\">http://youtu.be/jIbY2ikNtHU</a> ). \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_metaphor\" title=\"Metaphor\">Metaphor</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_simile\" title=\"Simile\">Simile</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_rquestion\" title=\"Rhetorical Question\">Rhetorical Question</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_idiom\" title=\"Idiom\">Idiom</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_irony\" title=\"Irony\">Irony</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_123person\" title=\"First, Second or Third Person\">First, Second or Third Person</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_you\" title=\"Forms of You\">Forms of You</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_youdual\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural\">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_yousingular\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Singular\">Forms of 'You' - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_explicit\" title=\"Explicit and Implicit\">Explicit and Implicit</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_explicitinfo\" title=\"Making Implicit Information Explicit\">Making Implicit Information Explicit</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_events\" title=\"Order of Events\">Order of Events</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_parables\" title=\"Parables\">Parables</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

The intent of a parable is to convey meaning through a story or word picture. A parable is not an actual account of an event; it is more like an imaginary or hypothetical example (e.g. This could happen). It can be used to explain the kingdom of Heaven by telling a story which the listeners can understand.  Because the lesson comes in the form of a story, the listener or reader can feel themselves being a part of it; it is more likely to make an impact on their lives.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nParables or teaching stories are best translated as closely as possible to the way they were originally told. Because the parables are set in the culture of Bible times, there may be things that are not easily understood by a modern audience. Follow the guidelines for translating unknown practices or things. But because these are parables and not real events, some things that are known to the target audience can be substituted for things that are unknown to them, as long as they existed in the time period. Parables are best translated as a situation that can be understood within your own culture. The parable is a teaching story, so it is important that all of the details and parts of the story support the main point of the story. It is important that you understand this main point of the parable before you translate it.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen Jesus told a parable, he did not always intend for his hearers to understand what it meant right away (for example, the parable of the farmer planting seeds). So do <em class=\"u\">not</em> try to explain the story or what Jesus was teaching, but simply translate the parable. Use the form that your language has for communicating that a narrative is an imaginative story (or even a story whose purpose is to teach something) and not an account of a historical event.\n</p>\n<p>\nParables seldom (if ever) contain the names of specific individuals (That may be a key for you in identifying what is a parable and what is a narrative account.)\n</p>\n<p>\n(See: <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_simile\" title=\"Simile\">Simile</a>, <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_metaphor\" title=\"Metaphor\">Metaphor</a>, <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_hypo\" title=\"Hypothetical Situations\">Hypothetical Situations</a>)\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nJesus said to them, “Certainly you will say this <em class=\"u\">proverb</em> to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself.

A beginning translator who was told to check his translation once said, “But I speak my native language perfectly. The translation is for that language. What more is needed?” What he said was true, but there are two more things to keep in mind. \n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing is that he may not have understood the source text correctly, and so someone who knows what it should say might be able to correct the translation. This could be because he did not correctly understand a phrase or expression in the source language. In this case, someone else who understands the source language well can correct the translation. \n</p>\n<p>\nOr it could be that he did not understand something about what the Bible meant to communicate at a certain place. In this case, someone who knows the Bible well, such as a Bible teacher or a Bible translation checker, can correct the translation. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe other thing is that, although the translator may know very well what the text should say, the way he translated it might mean something else to a different person. That is, another person might think that the translation is talking about something other than what the translator intended, or the person hearing or reading the translation might not understand what the translator was trying to say. That is why it is always necessary to check what someone else understands from the translation so that we can make it more accurate and more clear. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a guide to the process of checking, in the form of a scale with three levels.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis checking scale helps to show the extent to which the accuracy and clarity of a translation have been verified. These checking levels have been developed by the unfoldingWord network (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://unfoldingword.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://unfoldingword.org\">https://unfoldingword.org</a> ), the same group that manages Door43 with the help of many volunteers, and they are used to indicate the checking level of all biblical content on Door43.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >The Checking Levels</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThere are three checking levels:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/level1\" title=\"Checking Level One - Affirmation by Translation Team\">Checking Level One - Affirmation by Translation Team</a> </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/level2\" title=\"Checking Level Two - Affirmation by Community\">Checking Level Two - Affirmation by Community</a></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/level3\" title=\"Checking Level Three - Affirmation by Church Leadership\">Checking Level Three - Affirmation by Church Leadership</a>. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAny translation that has not yet been checked to Level One is considered to have not been checked and is assigned no checking status.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe purpose of having several Checking Levels is to make translated materials quickly available to the church, while also allowing the content to continue to be checked and corroborated in an open environment. At all times, the degree to which its accuracy has been checked will be clearly indicated. We believe this will result in a faster checking process, allow broad church participation and ownership, and produce better translations.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Credits: Quotation used by permission, © 2013, SIL International, Sharing Our Native Culture, p. 69.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/intro_levels\" title=\"Introduction to the Checking Levels\">Introduction to the Checking Levels</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

They can also be members of the community who are not part of the translation team. They should be speakers of the language of the translation, be respected in the community, and, if possible, know the Bible well in the language of wider communication. The purpose of this step is to make sure that the translation accurately communicates the meaning of the original story or Bible passage. The checkers will be helping the translation team think about the best way to translate the meaning of the story or Bible passage in their own language. There can be one person who checks a story or Bible passage, or more than one. Having more than one person checking a story or passage can be helpful, because often different checkers will notice different things. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Levels Two and Three</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe people who do the Level Two or Level Three accuracy check should not be members of the translation team. They should be church leaders who speak the language of the translation and who know the Bible well in the source language. It is true that the language community members who checked the translation for naturalness and clarity were not allowed to look at the source while they were doing their checking. But for accuracy testing, the new translation <em>must</em> be compared with the source text, or with the source in the original biblical languages.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >All Levels</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe people doing the checking should follow these steps:\n</p>\n<p>\n1. Each of the checkers should read the translation (or listen to the recording) by himself, comparing it to the original Bible passage or story in the language of wider communication. It can be helpful for the translator to read the translation out loud to the checker while the checker follows along looking at the source Bible or Bibles. As the checker reads (or listens to) the translation and compares it to the source, he should keep in mind these general questions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Does the translation add anything to the original meaning?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Is there any part of the meaning that is left out of the translation?</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Has the translation changed the meaning in any way?</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese questions can also be helpful for finding anything that might be inaccurate in the translation:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Was everything that was mentioned in the source language translation also mentioned in the flow of the new (local) translation? (Did the meaning of the new translation follow the message (not necessarily the wording) of the source translation? Sometimes if the arrangement of words or the order of ideas is different than in the source translation, it sounds better that way and is still accurate.)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Were the people introduced in each story doing the same things as those mentioned in the source language translation? (Was it easy to see who was doing the events of the new translation when it was compared to the source language?)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Are there translationWords used in the new translation that do not match your understanding of the words in the source version? (Think about things like this: How do your people talk about a priest (one who sacrifices to God) or a temple (the sacrifice place of the Jews) without using a word borrowed from the source language?)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Are the phrases used in the new translation helpful in understanding the more difficult phrases of the source translation? (Are the phrases of the new translation put together in a way that brings better understanding and still fit with the meaning of the source language translation?)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Another way to determine if the text is accurate is to ask comprehension questions about the translation, such as, “who did what, when, where, how, and why.” There are questions that have already been prepared to help with this. Click for <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/obs/notes/questions/home\" title=\"OBS translationQuestions\">OBS translationQuestions</a> or for <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home\" title=\"Bible translationQuestions\">Bible translationQuestions</a>. The answers to those questions should be the same as the answers to those questions about the source language translation. If they are not, there is a problem in the translation.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n2. The checker should make notes where he thinks there might be a problem or something to be improved. Each checker will discuss these notes with the translation team.\n</p>\n<p>\n3. After the checkers have checked a Bible Story or chapter individually, they should all meet with the translator or translation team and review the story or Bible passage together. As they come to the places where each checker made note of a problem or question, the checkers can ask their questions or make suggestions for improvement. As the checkers and the translation team discuss the questions and suggestions, they might think of other questions or new ways of saying things. This is good. As the checkers and the translation team work together, God will help them discover the best way to communicate the meaning of the story or Bible passage. \n</p>\n<p>\n4. After the checkers and the translation team have decided what they need to change, the translation team will revise the translation. \n</p>\n<p>\n5. After the translation team revises the translation, they should read it out loud to each other or to other members of the language community to make sure that it still sounds natural in their language. \n</p>\n<p>\n6. The translator (or team) makes a note of any Bible passages that are still difficult to understand, and where they would like additional help from other Bible checkers. These notes will be used by the church leaders and checkers in levels two and three, so that they can help the translators understand the meaning and communicate it more clearly. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/level2\" title=\"Checking Level Two - Affirmation by Community\">Checking Level Two - Affirmation by Community</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/language_community_check\" title=\"Language Community Check\">Language Community Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/church_leader_check\" title=\"Church Leader Check\">Church Leader Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/other_methods\" title=\"Other Methods\">Other Methods</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Before you read the translation, tell the people listening that you want them to stop you if they hear something that is not natural in their language. For more information on how to check a translation for naturalness, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/natural\" title=\"Natural Translation\">Natural Translation</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are a set of questions and answers for each Open Bible Story and for each chapter of the Bible that you can use to test the translation to make sure that it is communicating clearly.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Open Bible Stories translationQuestions: <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home\">https://door43.org/en/obs/notes/questions/home</a></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Bible translationQuestions: <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home\">https://door43.org/en/bible/questions/comprehension/home</a></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nTo use these questions, follow these steps:\n</p>\n<p>\n1. Read the passage of the translation to one or more members of the language community who will answer the questions. These members of the language community must be people who have not been involved in the translation before. In other words, the community members who are asked the questions should not already know the answers to the questions from working on the translation or from previous knowledge of the Bible. We want them to be able to answer the questions only from hearing or reading the translation of the story or Bible passage. This is how we will know if the translation is communicating clearly or not. For this same reason, it is important that the community members not look at a Bible while they are answering these questions.\n</p>\n<p>\n2. Ask the community members some of the questions for that passage, one question at a time. It is not necessary to use all of the questions for each story or chapter if it seems that the community members are understanding the translation well. \n</p>\n<p>\n3. After each question, a member of the language community will answer the question. If the person only answers with a “yes” or a “no,” then the questioner should ask a further question so that he can be sure that the translation is communicating well. A further question could be something like, “How do you know that?” or “What part of the translation tells you that?” \n</p>\n<p>\n4. Write down the answer that the person gives. If the person’s answer is similar to the suggested answer that has been provided for the question, then the translation of the story is clearly communicating the right information at that point. The answer does not have to be exactly the same as the suggested answer to be a right answer, but it should give basically the same information. Sometimes the suggested answer is very long. If the person answers with only part of the suggested answer, that is also a right answer. \n</p>\n<p>\n5. If the answer is unexpected or very different than the suggested answer, or if the person cannot answer the question, then the translation team will need to revise the part of the translation that communicates that information so that it communicates the information more clearly.\n</p>\n<p>\n6. After the translation team has revised the translation of the passage, then ask other members of the language community the same questions, that is, ask other speakers of the language who have not been involved in checking the same passage before. If they answer the questions correctly, then the translation is now communicating well.\n</p>\n<p>\n7. Repeat this process with each story or Bible chapter until members of the language community can answer the questions well, showing that the translation is communicating the right information clearly. The translation is ready for the church check of level 2 when language community members who have not heard the translation before can answer the questions correctly.\n</p>\n<p>\n8.

This helps to check the clarity and naturalness of the translation and offers alternate ways of saying the same thing. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Reading Method</strong>: Someone other than you, the translator or tester, should read a portion of the translation while you take notes where the pauses and mistakes occur. This will show how easy or how difficult it is to read and understand the translation. Look at the places in the translation where the reader paused or made mistakes and consider what part of the translation was difficult. You may need to revise the translation at those points so that it is easier to read and understand.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Offer Alternate translations</strong>: In areas where you are not sure of the best way to express a word or phrase, ask other people for an alternative translation or offer a choice between two translations and see which alternative translation people think is the most clear. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Reviewer Input</strong>: Let others whom you respect read your translation. Ask them to take notes and tell you where it might be improved. Look for better word choices, natural expressions, and even spelling adjustments. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Discussion Groups</strong>: Ask people to read the translation aloud in a group of people and allow them and others to ask questions for clarification. Pay attention to the words they use, since alternate words and expressions come up when someone is trying to make sense of a difficult point, and these alternate words and expressions might be better than the ones in the translation. Pay attention to the places where people do not understand the translation, and work to make those places clearer.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/writing_decisions\" title=\"Decisions for Writing Your Language\">Decisions for Writing Your Language</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/community_evaluation\" title=\"Language Community Evaluation Questions\">Language Community Evaluation Questions</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

You can read it to one other person who speaks the target language or to a group of people.

When someone stops you, then you can discuss together how someone would say that same thing in a more natural way.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is helpful to think about a situation in your village in which people would talk about the same kind of thing that the translation is talking about.

This following assessment is intended to suggest some of the most important techniques for checking a translation, rather than to describe every conceivable check that could be employed. Ultimately, the decision of what checks are used, when, and by whom should be made by the Church.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >How to Use the Assessment</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThis assessment method employs two types of statements. Some are “yes/no” statements where a negative response indicates a problem that must be resolved. Other sections use an equally-weighted method that provides translation teams and checkers with statements about the translation. Each statement should be scored by the person doing the check (beginning with the translation team) on a scale of 0-2:\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>0</strong> - disagree<br/>\n<strong>1</strong> - agree somewhat<br/>\n<strong>2</strong> - strongly agree\n</p>\n<p>\nAt the end of the review, the total value of all responses in a section should be added up and, if the responses accurately reflect the state of the translation, this value will provide the reviewer with an approximation of the probability that the translated chapter is of excellent quality. The rubric is designed to be simple and provide the reviewer with an objective method to assess where the work needs improvement. <em>For example, if the translation scores relatively well in “Accuracy” but quite poorly in “Naturalness” and “Clarity,” then the translation team needs to do more community checking.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe rubric is intended to be used for each chapter of translated biblical content. The translation team should do an assessment of each chapter after they finish their other checks, and then the level 2 church checkers should do it again, and then the level 3 checkers should also assess the translation with this checklist. As more detailed and extensive checking of the chapter is performed by the Church at each level, the points for the chapter should be updated from each of the first four sections (overview, naturalness, clarity, accuracy), allowing the church and community to see how the translation is improving. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >The Self-Assessment</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe process is divided into five parts: the <strong>overview</strong> (information about the translation itself), <strong>naturalness</strong>, <strong>clarity</strong>, <strong>accuracy</strong>, and <strong>Church approval</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1. Overview</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>circle either “yes” or “no” for each statement below.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>no | yes</strong> This translation is a meaning-based translation that attempts to communicate the meaning of the original text in ways that are natural, clear, and accurate in the target language.<br/>\n<strong>no | yes</strong> Those involved in checking the translation are first-language speakers of the target language.<br/>\n<strong>no | yes</strong> The translation of this chapter is in agreement with the Statement of Faith.<br/>\n<strong>no | yes</strong> The translation of this chapter has been done in accordance with the Translation Guidelines.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.

The leaders from these groups will verify that they approve of the distribution and use of the translation among the people affiliated with them. This approval is not required for distribution of the translation, but rather serves to validate it.\n</p>\n<p>\nThose who do Level Three checking need to be other than the people who did Level Two checking.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe intent of this level is to affirm the alignment of the translation with the intent of the original texts and the sound doctrine of the Church historic and universal, through the review and affirmation by the leadership of the Church that speaks the language. Level 3 is thus achieved by the mutual agreement of the leadership of multiple church networks. The Church networks should be representative of the churches in the language community. Those checking the translation should be first-language speakers of the language, and those signing off on the check are those in leadership roles in the Church networks. A leader of a Church network who is also a first-language speaker of the language of the translation could both check the translation and sign off on its quality. \n</p>\n<p>\nLevel 3 is completed when the translation has been thoroughly checked and approved by the leadership (or their delegates) of at least two church networks that have personnel trained in biblical languages and content.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo proceed with Level Three checking, Level Three checkers will click on the link below and answer the questions found on that page:\n</p>\n<p>\nGo to the Level Three checking questions (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/level3_questions\" title=\"Questions for Checking on Level Three\">Questions for Checking on Level Three</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/level3_questions\" title=\"Questions for Checking on Level Three\">Questions for Checking on Level Three</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/self_assessment\" title=\"Self-Assessment Rubric\">Self-Assessment Rubric</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Combining verses together is called a “verse bridge.” See <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_versebridge\" title=\"Verse Bridges\">Verse Bridges</a> for more information. Here is how to mark a verse bridge in the program:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Find the beginning of the combined verses.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2 node\"><div class=\"li\"> Move all of the verse markers to the beginning of the combined verses.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level3\"><div class=\"li\"> For example: if you are working on a chunk that has verse 1 and 2 combined into one verse you would move the markers for 1 and 2 to the beginning of the combined verse.  The verse 3 marker would go immediately after the combined verses (if verse 3 is on the same chunk.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Verse Marker in Another Chunk</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nSometimes a verse bridge may need to put 2 verses together that are not on the same chunk. Put the verse marker in the correct spot on the first chunk and then on the next chunk leave the verse marker at the beginning. Remember where the verse bridge was over two chunks, so it can be edited during the printing process.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Adding a Verse</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>This will be possible in future releases.</em> For now, type in the additional verse number.

The approver will look to see who contributed to the change and may contact the requestor and others involved with the translation of the text in question to ensure the changes are valid.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Must All Contributors Be Named?</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nDue to copyright laws (and these exist no matter what country you are in and no matter what people tell you about laws in that country), you must list <em class=\"u\">every</em> contributor on the Request to Publish form and provide a legal signature for each person. In certain cases we understand they cannot be named, however you can provide the established pseudonym for that person.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/process/publishing_process\" title=\"How to Publish\">How to Publish</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/tech/ts_resources\" title=\"Find the Resources in translationStudio\">Find the Resources in translationStudio</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/tech/ts_useresources\" title=\"How to Use the Resources in translationStudio\">How to Use the Resources in translationStudio</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/tech/ts_upload\" title=\"Upload Your Work\">Upload Your Work</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/tech/translate_helpts\" title=\"Finding Help for translationStudio\">Finding Help for translationStudio</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/tech/ts_problem\" title=\"Report a Problem\">Report a Problem</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Your goal as a Bible translator is to communicate the same message that the original writer of the Bible intended to communicate. This means that you should not try to communicate your own message, or the message that you think the Bible should say, or that your church thinks that the Bible should say. For any Bible passage, you must communicate what it says, all of what it says, and only what it says. You must resist the temptation to put any of your own interpretations or messages into the Bible or add any meaning to the message that is not there in the Bible passage.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou must also use key terms that are faithful to the vocabulary of the original biblical languages. Read the definitions of the translationWords to make sure that you understand the meanings of these words. Translate so that these key terms have these same meanings, and do not translate them in different ways just to please your pastor, your village leaders, or yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlways translating faithfully can be difficult for several reasons:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> You might be used to the way that your church interprets some Bible passages, and not know that there are other interpretations.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Example: When you are translating the word “baptize,” you might want to translate it with a word that means “sprinkle,” because that is what your church does. But after reading translationWords, you learn that the word needs to have a meaning in the range of “plunge,” “dip,” “wash,” or “purify.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> You might want to translate a Bible passage in a way that accords with your culture, rather than according to what it meant when it was written.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Example: It is common in North American culture for women to speak and preach in churches. A translator from that culture might be tempted to translate the words of 1 Corinthians 14:34 in a way that is not as strict as the Apostle Paul wrote them: “the women should keep silent in the churches.” But a faithful translator will translate the meaning of the Bible passage just the way it is.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> You might not like something that the Bible says, and be tempted to change it.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Example: You might not like what Jesus says in John 6:53, “Truly, truly, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves.” This may seem disgusting to you. But you must translate it faithfully, so that your people can read it and contemplate what Jesus meant by it.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> You might be afraid of what others in your village will think or do if they read a faithful translation of what the Bible says.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Example: You might be tempted to translate God's words in Matthew 3:17, “This is my beloved Son. I am very pleased with him,” with a word that does not mean “son.” But you must remember that you do not have the right to change the meaning of what the Bible says.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> You might know something about the Bible passage that you are translating and want to add that to what the passage says so that your readers will also know it.</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> Example: When you are translating Mark 10:11, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her,” you might know that in Matthew 19:9 there is also the phrase, “…except for sexual immorality….” Even so, do not add this phrase into Mark 10:11, because that would not be translating faithfully. Also, do not add any of your own ideas or teachings from your church. Only translate the meaning that is there in the Bible passage.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIn order to avoid these biases, especially the ones that you might not be aware of, you must study the translationNotes (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home\">https://door43.org/en/bible/notes/home</a> ), translationWords (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/obe/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/obe/home\">https://door43.org/en/obe/home</a> ) and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/udb/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/udb/home\">https://door43.org/en/udb/home</a> ), as well as any other translation helps that you have.

Whenever two or more translations of the Bible disagree about the meaning of a Bible passage, it is the original languages that have the final authority for deciding the meaning. Sometimes people are very loyal to certain Bible translations that they are used to reading, and might argue with other people who are loyal to a different Bible translation. But neither of those Bible translations are the highest authority, because they are only translations of the original. All translations are secondary in authority to the original languages. That is why we must always refer to the original biblical languages when deciding how to translate the Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince not all translation teams have a member who can read the original languages of the Bible, it is not always possible to refer to the biblical languages when translating the Bible. Instead, the translation team has to rely on translations that they are able to read that have, in turn, been based on the biblical languages. Many of the translations in the Gateway Languages were translated from the biblical languages, including the ULB, but some are translations of translations. It is easy for errors to be introduced when a translation is two or three steps removed from the original. To help with this problem, the translation team can do three things:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The translation team must use translationNotes, translationWords, and any other translation helps they have to help them translate in the best way. These translation helps were written by Bible scholars who know the original biblical languages.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> They should compare their translation with as many other reliable translations as they can, to make sure that it is communicating the same message as the others.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Someone who has studied the biblical languages should review the translation to make sure that it is accurate. This person could be a church leader, pastor, seminary professor, or Bible translation professional.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nSometimes Bible translations differ because some passages in the Bible are unclear or ambiguous in the original biblical languages. In that case, the translation team must choose between them based on what Bible scholars say in translationNotes, translationWords, the UDB, and other translation helps. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_collaborative\" title=\"Create Collaborative Translations\">Create Collaborative Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_faithful\" title=\"Create Faithful Translations\">Create Faithful Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_historical\" title=\"Create Historical Translations\">Create Historical Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_ongoing\" title=\"Create Ongoing Translations\">Create Ongoing Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_equal\" title=\"Create Equal Translations\">Create Equal Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_discover\" title=\"Discover the Meaning of the Text\">Discover the Meaning of the Text</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

The events of the Bible happened in the way that the Bible describes at different times in history. Therefore, when you translate the Bible, you need to communicate that these events happened, and do not change any of the details of what happened. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The books of the Bible were written down at specific times in history for people of a certain culture. This means that some things in the Bible that were very clear to the original hearers and readers will not be clear to those who read the Bible in different times and in different cultures. This is because both the writer and the readers were familiar with many of the practices that the writer wrote about, and so the writer did not need to explain them. We, from other times and cultures, are not familiar with these things, and so we need someone to explain them to us. This kind of information is called “implicit information.” See <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_explicit\" title=\"Explicit and Implicit\">Explicit and Implicit</a>. </div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nSo as translators, we need to translate the historical details accurately, but also provide some explanation when we think that our readers will need it so that they can understand what the translation is about.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> For example, Genesis 12:16 refers to camels. For readers in parts of the world where this animal is unknown, it might be good to provide a description. The best way to do this is in a footnote, or in a glossary entry such as the one in translationWords.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSome explanation can be included in the text, as long as it is brief and does not distract the reader from the main point of the text.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> For example, the New Testament writers often referred to events in the Old Testament, but without explaining what they were referring to. They knew that their readers were very familiar with the Old Testament, and did not need any explanation. But it is possible that readers from other times and places will need some explanation.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nLet us compare <strong>1 Corinthians 10:1</strong> from the ULB and UDB.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“I want you to know, brothers and sisters that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea. “  (ULB)</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n“I want you to remember, brothers and sisters, that our Jewish ancestors were following God, who led them as a cloud during the day, as they passed through the Red Sea on dry land, long ago in the time of the Exodus.”  (UDB)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nNotice that the UDB makes several points explicit: the ‘fathers were all under the cloud’ tells of the time that God led the Jewish ancestors as a cloud. The statement that ‘our fathers passed through the sea’ is also about the ‘passing through the Red Sea in the time of the exodus.’ The UDB translator decided to explicitly describe the historical events. This is a way to translate historical events that is more meaningful for those who have little knowledge of Old Testament history.\n</p>\n<p>\nInclude or refer to the needed implicit information intended by the original writer that will be necessary for your community to understand what is written.\n</p>\n<p>\nMaintain the historical accuracy of the message.  Avoid referring to items and events that were not present in the Bible times.  Do not make your translation sound like it is a modern day event.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Keep true to the historical text. The original message, historical events, and cultural background information should all be the same as it was written in the source text. For example, the translation must not have the message rewritten so that events happened at a different place or time.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Communicate clearly by expressing the message in such a way that people in the Target Language culture will be able to understand the meaning that the original author intended to communicate.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Only provide additional information as needed to accurately communicate the intended message to people who do not share the same context and culture as the recipients of the original content.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_collaborative\" title=\"Create Collaborative Translations\">Create Collaborative Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_clear\" title=\"Create Clear Translations\">Create Clear Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_natural\" title=\"Create Natural Translations\">Create Natural Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/guidelines_accurate\" title=\"Create Accurate Translations\">Create Accurate Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_faithful\" title=\"Create Faithful Translations\">Create Faithful Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_ongoing\" title=\"Create Ongoing Translations\">Create Ongoing Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_authoritative\" title=\"Create Authoritative Translations\">Create Authoritative Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/guidelines_equal\" title=\"Create Equal Translations\">Create Equal Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_discover\" title=\"Discover the Meaning of the Text\">Discover the Meaning of the Text</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Especially notice the forms in the source text that communicate certain kinds of emotions, and choose forms in the target language that communicate the same emotions. Examples of some of these forms follow.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Idiom</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nDetermine the meaning of difficult idioms, proverbs and figures of speech and translate them with meaningful expressions in your language.  Usually idioms cannot be translated literally into another language. The meaning of the idiom has to be expressed in a way that is natural in the other language.\n</p>\n<p>\nHere are three translations, all with the same meaning, of Acts 18:6:  \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> “Your blood be upon your heads! I am innocent . . . ”  (RSV) </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> “If you are lost, you yourselves must take the blame for it! I am not responsible . . . ” (GNB) </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> “If God punishes you, it is because of you, not me!” (TFT)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese are all accusations of guilt. Some are using idioms with the word “blood” or “lost,” while the third is more direct using the word “punishes.” In order for your translation to be equal, it must also express an accusation in an emotional way, and may use an idiom, as long as both the form of the accusation and the idiom are appropriate for the target language and culture. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Figure of Speech</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nA figure of speech is a special way of saying something in order to catch the attention or express an emotion about what is said. Often the meaning of a figure of speech is different from the literal meaning of the words. The meaning is not intended to be taken literally. \n</p>\n<p>\nHere are some examples:\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I was shattered!</strong>   The speaker was not literally broken into pieces, but he felt very bad.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>He closed his ears to what I was saying.</strong>  Meaning, “he chose to not listen to what I was saying.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The wind moaned in the trees.</strong> This means that the wind blowing through the trees sounded like a person moaning.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The whole world came to the meeting.</strong>  Everyone in the world did not attend the meeting. Most likely there were many people at the meeting.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach language has different kinds of figures of speech. The important thing is that you can:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> recognize that a figure of speech is being used,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> recognize its purpose, and </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> know the real meaning.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIt is the <em class=\"u\"><strong>real meaning</strong></em> that should be translated into your language, not the meaning of the individual words. Once you understand the real meaning, you can choose an expression in the target language that communicates that same meaning and emotion.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information be sure to review the Figures of Speech (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_intro\" title=\"Figures of Speech\">Figures of Speech</a>) lessons as well.  \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Rhetorical Questions</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\n<strong>Rhetorical questions</strong> (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_rquestion\" title=\"Rhetorical Question\">Rhetorical Question</a>) are another way that the speaker captures the attention of the reader. Rhetorical questions are a type of question that does not expect an answer or ask for information. They usually express some kind of emotion and can be intended as a rebuke, a warning, or to express surprise.\n</p>\n<p>\nSee, for example, Matthew 3:7: “You offspring of poisonous snakes, who warned you to flee from the wrath that is coming?”\n</p>\n<p>\nHere no answer is expected. The speaker is not asking for information, he is rebuking his hearers: it does no good to warn these people of God's wrath, because they refuse the only way to escape it: to repent of their sins.  \n</p>\n<p>\nYou may need to restate this rhetorical question as a statement when you translate, if your language does not use rhetorical questions in this way.

The original language of the New Testament is Greek. The original language of most of the Old Testament is Hebrew. However, the original language of some parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra is Aramaic. The original language is always the most accurate language from which to translate a passage.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe source Language is the language from which the translation is being made. If a translator is translating the Bible from the original languages, then the original language and the source language for his translation are the same. However, only people who have spent many years studying the original languages understand them and can use them as a source language. For that reason, most translators use Bibles that have been translated into a language of wider communication as their source language text. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are translating from a language of wider communication, it is a good idea to have someone who has studied the original languages compare the meaning in the target language translation with the meaning in the original language to make sure that the meaning is the same. Another way to make sure that the meaning of the target language translation is accurate is to check the translation with translation helps that have been written by people who know the original languages. These would include Bible commentaries and dictionaries, as well as the unfoldingWord translationNotes, translationWords definitions, and translationQuestions with their answers.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Source Language may not be Accurate</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIf the translator does not understand the original language, he will have to use a language of wider communication as a source language. The meaning in the source may be correct, depending on how carefully it was translated from the original. But it is still a translation, so it is a step away from the original and is not quite the same. In some cases, the source may have actually been translated from another source, rather than from the original, putting it two steps away from the original.\n</p>\n<p>\nConsider the example below. A translator uses a Swahili New Testament as the source for a new target language translation. However, the particular Swahili Bible version he is using was actually translated from English — not directly from the Greek (the original language of the NT). So it is possible that some of the meaning has changed in the chain of translation from the original to the target languages. \n<img alt=\"\" class=\"media\" height=\"174\" src=\"/assets/img/ta/ol2sl2sl2tl_small_600-174.png\" width=\"600\"/>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe only way to make sure the translation is as accurate as possible is to compare the new translation with the original languages. Where this is not possible, use the ULB as the source text, along with other Bible translations that were translated from the original languages. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_chapverse\" title=\"Chapter and Verse Numbers\">Chapter and Verse Numbers</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_manuscripts\" title=\"Original Manuscripts\">Original Manuscripts</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translate_terms\" title=\"Terms to Know\">Terms to Know</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_textvariants\" title=\"Textual Variants\">Textual Variants</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

So the Old Testament was translated into Greek. When Christ came, many people still spoke Greek as a second language, and the New Testament books were all written in Greek.\n</p>\n<p>\nBack then there were no printers, so the authors wrote these books by hand. These were the original manuscripts. Those who copied these manuscripts also did so by hand. These were also manuscripts. These books are extremely important, so the copiers got special training and were very careful to try to copy them accurately.\n</p>\n<p>\nOver hundreds of years, people made thousands of copies of the Bible books. The manuscripts that the authors originally wrote have all been lost or fallen apart, so we do not have them. But we do have many of the copies that were written long ago.

If the numbering system in the ULB is different from the numbering system in another Bible that you use, you will probably want to use the system from that Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reason this is a translation issue:</strong> - People who speak your language may also use a Bible written in another language.

There are two kinds of hyperbole:\n</p>\n<p>\n1. Exaggeration: This is when a speaker deliberately describes something by an extreme or even unreal statement, usually to show his strong feeling or opinion about it.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nWhoever does not <em class=\"u\">carry his own cross</em> and come after me cannot be my disciple.  (Luke 14:27) </div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis is an exaggeration. It means that whoever wants to be Jesus' disciple must be determined to follow him faithfully, even if his enemies were to kill that person.\n</p>\n<p>\n2. Generalization: This is when a speaker uses words like “every” or “all” to mean something like “very many,” but not “<em class=\"u\">every</em>  one.” (Some people may not call generalization like this “hyperbole.”)\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nMoses was educated in <em class=\"u\">all the learning of the Egyptians</em>  (Acts 7:22)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis is a generalization. It means that he had learned much of what the Egyptians knew and taught.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reason this is a translation issue</strong> - If readers do not understand that a statement is a hyperbole, they may either think that something happened that did not happen, or they may think that the speaker or writer was saying something that is not true. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n</div>\n<h4 >Examples of Exaggeration</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nIf your hand causes you to stumble, <em class=\"u\">cut it off</em>. It is better for you to enter into life maimed…  (Mark 9:43)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nWhen Jesus said to cut off your hand, he meant that we should do whatever extreme things we need to do in order not to sin. He used this hyperbole to show how extremely important it is to try to stop sinning. \n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nIf anyone comes to me and does not <em class=\"u\">hate</em> his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers and sisters–yes, and his own life also–he cannot be my disciple.  (Luke 14:26)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nBecause of many other things that Jesus said, we know that his use of the word “hate” here is hyperbole. He meant that we must not love even our own family members more than we love him. We must love him more than we love ourselves or anyone else.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nThe Philistines gathered together to fight against Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand men to drive the chariots, and troops <em class=\"u\">as numerous as the sand on the seashore</em>.  (1 Samuel 13:5)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe underlined phrase is an exaggeration. It means that there were  many, many soldiers in the Philistine army. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Examples of Generalization</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nThey found him, and they said to him, “<em class=\"u\">Everyone</em> is looking for you.”  (Mark 1:37)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe disciples told Jesus that everyone was looking looking for him. They probably did not mean that everyone in the city was looking for him, but that many people were looking for him, or that all of Jesus closest friends there were looking for him.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nBut as his anointing teaches you about <em class=\"u\">all things</em> and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, remain in him.  (1 John 2:27) </div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThis is a generalization. God's Spirit teaches us about all things that we need to know.\n</p>\n<p>\nNote: Do not assume that something must be hyperbole just because it seems to be impossible.

We use the term  <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_doublet\" title=\"Doublet\">Doublet</a> for words or very short phrases that mean basically the same thing and are used together. \n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nYahweh <em class=\"u\">sees everything a person does</em> and <em class=\"u\">watches all the paths he takes</em>.  (Proverbs 5:21) </div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe first underlined phrase and the second underlined phrase mean the same thing. There are three ideas that are the same between these to phrases. “Sees” corresponds to “watches,” “everything … does” corresponds to “all the paths … takes,” and “a person” corresponds to “he.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSynonymous parallelism in poetry has several effects:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It shows that something is very important by saying it more than once and in more than one way. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It helps the hearer to think more deeply about the idea by saying it in different ways. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It makes the language more beautiful and above the ordinary way of speaking. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Reason this is a Translation Issue</strong>: In some languages people do not expect someone to say the same thing twice, even in different ways. They expect that if there are two phrases or two sentences, they must have different meanings. So they  do not understand that the repetition of ideas serves to emphasize the idea. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nYour word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.  (Psalm 119:105)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nBoth parts of the sentences are metaphors saying that God's word teaches people how to live. The words 'lamp' and 'light' are similar in meaning because they refer to light, and the words 'my feet' and 'my path' are related, because they refer to a person walking. \n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nPraise Yahweh, all you nations; exalt him, all you peoples!  (Psalm 117:1)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nBoth parts of this verse tell people everywhere to praise Yahweh. The words 'Praise' and 'exalt' mean the same thing, 'Yahweh' and 'him' refer to the same person, and 'all you nations' and 'all you peoples' refer to the same people.  \n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nFor Yahweh has a lawsuit with his people, and he will contend with Israel.  (Micah 6:2)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe two parts of this verse say that Yahweh has a serious disagreement with his people, Israel. These are not two different disagreements or two different groups of people. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Strategies</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIf your language uses parallelism and it would be appropriate consider using it.

These are things that cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense, such as happiness, weight, injury, unity, friendship, health, and reason. This is a translation issue because some languages may express a certain idea with an abstract noun, while others would need a different way to express it. For example, “What is its <em class=\"u\">weight</em>?” could be expressed as “How much does it <em class=\"u\">weigh</em>?” or “How <em class=\"u\">heavy</em> is it?”\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Description</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nRemember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. <strong>ABSTRACT NOUNS</strong> are nouns that refer to attitudes, qualities, events, situations, or even to relationships among these ideas. These are things that cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense, such as joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, truth, freedom, vengeance, slowness, length, and weight.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbstract nouns allow us to express thoughts about ideas in fewer words than if we did not have those nouns. For example, we can say, “I believe in the forgiveness of sin.” But if English did not have the two abstract nouns “forgiveness” and “sin,” then we would have to make a longer sentence to express the same meaning. We would have to say, for example, “I believe that God is willing to forgive people after they have sinned.”\n</p>\n<p>\nAbstract nouns also allow us to refer to a situation without telling more details about it than we want to tell. For example, we can say “I got here late because there was an accident on the highway.” “Accident” is an abstract noun. If it does not matter whose accident it was, or what kind of accident it was, then it can be better if I do not have to say these things about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reason this is a translation issue</strong>: The Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use phrases to express those ideas. Those phrases will have other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs, that express some of the meaning in the abstract noun.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nfrom <em class=\"u\">childhood</em> you have known the sacred writings  (2 Timothy 3:15)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe abstract noun “childhood” refers to when someone is a child.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nBut <em class=\"u\">godliness</em> with <em class=\"u\">contentment</em> is great <em class=\"u\">gain</em>.  (1 Timothy 6:6)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe abstract nouns “godliness” and “contentment” refer to being godly and content. The abstract noun “gain” refers to something that benefits or helps someone.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nToday <em class=\"u\">salvation</em> has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.  (Luke 19:9)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe abstract noun “salvation” here refers to being saved.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nThe Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider <em class=\"u\">slowness</em> to be  (2 Peter 3:9)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe abstract noun “slowness” refers how slowly something is done.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nHe will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the <em class=\"u\">purposes</em> of the heart.  (1 Corinthians 4:5)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe abstract noun “purposes” refers to the things that people want to do and the reasons they want to do them.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Strategies</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIf an abstract noun would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it.

Some languages also have prefixes or suffix that express the negative as in  “<em class=\"u\">un</em>happy,” “<em class=\"u\">im</em>possible,” and “use<em class=\"u\">less</em>.” Some languages can also express the negative with pronouns like “none,” “nothing,” and “no one,” with adverbs like “nowhere,” and with prepositions like “without.”\n</p>\n<p>\nA double negative occurs when a sentence has two words that express the meaning of “not”.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nIt is <em class=\"u\">not</em> that we do <em class=\"u\">not</em> have authority  (2 Thessalonians 3:9)</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nAnd this better confidence did <em class=\"u\">not</em> happen <em class=\"u\">without</em> the taking of an oath,  (Hebrews 7:20)</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nBe sure of this—wicked people will <em class=\"u\">not</em> go <em class=\"u\">un</em>punished  (Proverbs 11:21)</div></blockquote>\n</div>\n<h4 >Reason this is a translation issue</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nDouble negatives mean very different things in different languages.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> In some languages, such as Spanish, a double negative emphasizes the negative.

More detailed pages on pronouns can be found on <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_singularpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Singular\">Pronouns - Singular</a> and <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_pluralpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Plural\">Pronouns - Plural</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CONJUNCTIONS </strong> are very common words in English and join things (i.e. words, sentences). Examples of conjunctions include: and, or, but, for, yet and nor. Correlative conjunctions contrast things and must be used in pairs: both/and; either/or; neither/nor; not only/but also.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PREPOSITIONS </strong> are words that begin phrases which connect a noun or verb with more detail. For example, “The boat was <em>off the shore</em>.” Off is a preposition (in an adverb phrase) that gives location information. Another example would be “The crowd <em>around Jesus</em> grew in numbers.” Around is a preposition (in an adjective phrase) helping us understand which crowd. Preposition examples include: aboard, above, among, before, behind, beyond, except, inside, through, toward, underneath, within.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLES</strong> are the term used to describe the words: a, an, the. “The” is a definite article which means a specific one (e.g. the dog) instead of a generic description such as “a dog.” 'A' is used preceding words that start with a consonant letter (e.g. a book); 'An' is used preceding words beginning with a vowel (e.g. an egg). Articles are actually part of a larger group of words called adjectives.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ADJECTIVES</strong> are a group of words that describe nouns and convey such things as quantity, size and color; they help us identity 'which one' or 'what kind.' Some times people use adjectives to tell which one, and sometimes people use them to tell something about them. For example - My eldest sister (“Eldest” tells which one.) My elderly father (“Elderly” tells something about my father). \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ADVERBS</strong> are a group of words that describe verbs (or adjectives) and tell such things as how, when, why, to what extent or where. The majority of adverbs end in 'ly.',\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GERUNDS</strong> are verbs changed into nouns by adding 'ing' to the end of the verb. For example: Reading delivers treasures.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INFINITIVES</strong> are words with 'to' placed in front of a verb. For example, 'To learn the details of English is challenging.'\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_abstractnouns\" title=\"Abstract Nouns\">Abstract Nouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_activepassive\" title=\"Active or Passive\">Active or Passive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_doublenegatives\" title=\"Double Negatives\">Double Negatives</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_ellipsis\" title=\"Ellipsis\">Ellipsis</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive\" title=\"Exclusive\">Exclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_123person\" title=\"First, Second or Third Person\">First, Second or Third Person</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_you\" title=\"Forms of You\">Forms of You</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_youdual\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural\">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_yousingular\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Singular\">Forms of 'You' - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_youformal\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal\">Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_gendernotations\" title=\"Gender Notations\">Gender Notations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_genitivecase\" title=\"Genitive Case\">Genitive Case</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_grammar\" title=\"Grammar Topics\">Grammar Topics</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive\" title=\"Inclusive\">Inclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_singularpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Singular\">Pronouns - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_pluralpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Plural\">Pronouns - Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_rpronouns\" title=\"Reflexive Pronouns\">Reflexive Pronouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_quotations\" title=\"Speech Quotations\">Speech Quotations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_sentences\" title=\"Sentences\">Sentences</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_verbs\" title=\"Verbs\">Verbs</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

'<em>Pick that up.</em>'</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSentences can be used for other purposes as well.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Sentence Structure</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe simplest sentence structure in English includes a  <em> <strong> subject  </strong> </em> and an  <em> <strong> action  </strong> </em> word. '  <em> The boy ran.'  </em>\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Subject</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe <em><strong>subject</strong></em> is who or what the sentence is about. In these examples, the subject is underlined: 1) <em>'<em class=\"u\">The boy</em>  is running.'</em>  2) <em>'<em class=\"u\">He</em>  is running.'</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nSubjects are typically typically noun phrases or pronouns. (See: <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_partsofspeech\" title=\"Parts of Speech\">Parts of Speech</a> for more information.) In the examples above, “the boy” is a noun phrase that has the noun 'boy,' and “he” is a pronoun.\n</p>\n<p>\nSometimes a subject is not stated but is implied. For example, <em>'Close the door</em>.' The verb is 'close'; the subject is implied to be 'you.' See <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_explicitinfo\" title=\"Making Implicit Information Explicit\">Making Implicit Information Explicit</a> for more information.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Predicate</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe predicate is the part of a sentence which tells something about the subject. It usually has a verb (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_verbs\" title=\"Verbs\">Verbs</a>).\n</p>\n<p>\nHere are some examples:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n'<em>The man is strong</em>.' </div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe subject is '<em>the man</em>' and the predicate is '<em>is strong</em>' (It describes the man.)\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n'<em>He worked hard</em>.'</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe subject is '<em>he</em>' and the predicate is '<em>worked hard</em>' (It is something the man did.)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe verb may have an object or a complement:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n<em>'The man made a garden.'</em> </div></blockquote>\n<p>\n“The man” is the subject. “Made” is the verb. “A garden” is the object.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n<em>'The man is strong.'</em> </div></blockquote>\n<p>\n“The man” is the subject. “Is” is the verb. “Strong” is the complement.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Clause</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nA sentence can have more than one set of subjects and predicates. Such sentences are compound sentences, Compound sentences are separated by a comma and a conjunction (i.e. but, and, or). Here is an example:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n'<em><em class=\"u\">He planted the yams</em> and <em class=\"u\">his wife planted the corn</em></em>.'</div></blockquote>\n<p>\n'<em>He planted the yams</em>' is one clause. '<em>His wife planted the corn</em>' is another clause.\n</p>\n<p>\n'<em>He planted the yams</em>' is a complete thought/sentence. '<em>His wife planted the corn</em>' is also a complete thought/sentence.\n</p>\n<p>\nSentences can also include <strong>CLAUSES</strong>. A clause is an incomplete thought that supports the full sentence. A clause is not a full sentence.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n'<em><em class=\"u\">When the corn was ready</em>, his wife picked it</em>.'</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe clause “when the corn was ready” is a clause, but it is not a full sentence. “His wife picked it up” is a complete sentence.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn some languages, clauses can tell about something in the sentence. These are called <strong>relative</strong> clauses.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Relative clauses can <strong>define </strong>  which thing is being talked about. For example: '<em>She put a little food in her own bag and a lot of food in the bag <em class=\"u\">that belonged to her sister</em></em>.' This relative clause '<em>that belonged to her sister</em>' defines which bag.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Relative clauses can <strong>describe</strong>  or tell some more information. For example: '<em>She gave some of the food to her only sister, <em class=\"u\">who was very thankful</em>.</em>' The clause “<em>who was very thankful</em>” tells something about the sister. Since she had only one sister, it does not tell which sister. It simply tells how her sister responded.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSome languages can use relative clauses both to define and describe. Other languages only use them for defining.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nMany sentences in the Bible have more than one clause. And each clause can have phrases in addition to the subject and verb.\n</p>\n<p>\nA language may have a preferred order for its clauses and other phrases. For example some languages may prefer the order in the first example, while others may prefer the order in the second.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em>She went to the garden to pick some tomatoes.</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em>In order to pick some tomatoes, she went to the garden.</em></div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nA language may have a preferred word order for its subject, verb, and object or complement. (See: <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a>) For example, English and French normally put the object after the verb. But if the object is a pronoun, French puts it before the verb.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> English: <em>The man sees <em class=\"u\">the house</em>.</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> French: <em>L'homme voit <em class=\"u\">la maison</em>. </em>  (The man sees the house.)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> English: <em>The man sees <em class=\"u\">it</em>. </em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> French: <em>L'homme <em class=\"u\">la</em>  voit. </em>  (The man it sees.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nEven within the noun phrase, languages have different word orders. For example, in English, adjectives come before the noun they describe. But in French, adjectives can occur before or after the noun, depending on their type.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> English: <em>the <em class=\"u\">pretty</em>  flower</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> French: <em>la <em class=\"u\">jolie</em>  fleur</em>  (the pretty flower)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> English:<em> the <em class=\"u\">purple</em>  flower</em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> French:<em> la fleur <em class=\"u\">violette</em></em> (The flower violette)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nTranslators should become aware of the following things in their language: the normal orders of clauses in sentences, the normal order of phrases in clauses, and the normal order of words in phrases. If their language allows variety, translators should learn what each variety is used to communicate.\n</p>\n<p>\nTranslators should became aware of the kinds of clauses their language has and their functions. They should understand the purposes of the clauses in the language they are translating from. When they are translating into their language, they should use the types of clauses and the clause orders that are natural in their own language and that have the same meaning as that of the language they are translating form .\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, the relative clause in the examples below give added information about the house. Languages that do not use relative clauses and languages that do not use relative clauses for that purpose, will need another way of expressing the information.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> '<em>After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to her <strong>house</strong>, <em class=\"u\">which was in the village</em></em>.'</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> '<em>After putting the food in the bags, she brought them to her house.

Many languages use more verbs than English does. The portion of the sentence which contains the verb is called the predicate.\n</p>\n<p>\nEvents are usually expressed by <strong>VERBS</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe context of the sentence determines the type of verb because some can function in different ways. For example, “The fish tasted oily,” uses tasted as a linking verb that describes the subject (the fish). “John tasted the fish” uses tasted as an action verb showing what the subject (John) did.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome verbs require a 'helper' and thus become a verb phrase. Examples include: am eating, are running, have been eating, will be eating.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Verb Tense</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nJust as time can be expressed as past, present and future, verbs also have these tenses. The verb reflects when the action takes place. Perfect tenses of verbs indicate continuing action (either continuous from a time past or continuous into the future).\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Verbs and Objects</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAll sentences have a SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT), VERB (EVENT), and OBJECT (PARTICIPANT). English grammar allows for not stating the object of the verb so that the sentence may only have the SUBJECT (PARTICIPANT) and VERB (EVENT) stated.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>\nExamples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> '<em>He has been <strong>singing</strong>  for three hours</em>.'  The object is not stated.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> '<em>He has been <strong>singing</strong> <em class=\"u\">hymns</em>  for three hours.</em>'   “Hymns” is the object of “singing.”</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nNote that different languages have different orders (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a>) for these parts of the sentences. In the examples below, the subject is first, the verb is bold, and the object is underlined. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn English, it is sometimes ok to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He <strong>sang</strong> <em class=\"u\">a song</em>.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He likes to <strong>sing</strong>.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIn some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. In all of these sentences, English can leave out the object.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He likes to <strong>sing</strong> <em class=\"u\">songs</em>.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He likes to <strong>cook</strong> <em class=\"u\">food</em>.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He has not <strong>eaten</strong> <em class=\"u\">anything</em>  in three days.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He is blind. He cannot <strong>see</strong> <em class=\"u\">anything</em>.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nSometimes you may need to include an object even if there is no object in English.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Singular &amp; Plural Subjects - Verb Agreement</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nNouns and Pronouns have the ability to be either singular (meaning “one”) or plural (meaning “more than one”). For the majority of English words, plurals are formed simply by adding an 's' to the root word.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Singular Pronouns (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_singularpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Singular\">Pronouns - Singular</a>) &amp; Plural Pronouns (see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_pluralpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Plural\">Pronouns - Plural</a>) pages have more information. Basically, singular pronouns include I, you, he, she and it. Plural pronouns include you, they and we. “It” refers back to nouns (the antecedent) which are non-human. There are collective nouns which describe quantities in excess of one but which remain singular in treatment; for example, team refers to several people. However, in a sentence, team is singular. (e.g. The team is tired.)\n</p>\n<p>\nVerb agreement requires matching singular subjects with singular verbs. An example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> 'The voter is angry.' One voter (singular) uses a singular verb (is).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> 'The voters are angry.' Many voters (plural) uses a plural verb (are).</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nMost of the time in English:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Nouns that are plural have an 's' on the end; verbs that are plural do not.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Singular verbs typically have an 's' on the end and their subject will not (e.g. A dog eats. Two dogs eat.)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nPronouns work the same way; it is important to use the right verb for each of the pronouns. The chart below shows the “Be” verb (in present and past tense) with each of the pronouns; the first four are singular in form and the remaining ones are plural.\n</p>\n<div class=\"table sectionedit4\"><table class=\"inline\">\n<tr class=\"row0\">\n<td class=\"col0 leftalign\"><strong>Pronoun</strong> </td><td class=\"col1 leftalign\"><strong>Present</strong> </td><td class=\"col2 leftalign\"><strong>Past</strong> </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row1\">\n<td class=\"col0\">I </td><td class=\"col1\">am </td><td class=\"col2\">was </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row2\">\n<td class=\"col0\">he </td><td class=\"col1\">is </td><td class=\"col2\">was </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row3\">\n<td class=\"col0\">she </td><td class=\"col1\">is </td><td class=\"col2\">was </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row4\">\n<td class=\"col0\">it </td><td class=\"col1\">is </td><td class=\"col2\">was </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row5\">\n<td class=\"col0\">you </td><td class=\"col1\">are </td><td class=\"col2\">were </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row6\">\n<td class=\"col0\">they </td><td class=\"col1\">are </td><td class=\"col2\">were </td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row7\">\n<td class=\"col0\">we </td><td class=\"col1\">are </td><td class=\"col2\">were </td>\n</tr>\n</table></div>\n\n</div>\n<h4 >Modal Verbs</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nA special group of verbs called <em><strong>modal verbs</strong></em> create special challenges. These verbs function in different ways in sentences; their purpose can only be determined in context. Modal verbs can be used to convey responsibilities, expectations, inferences, possibilities or needs. Several examples are giving below under <strong>English Oddities</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\nModal verbs include: can, may, must, should, would\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Some English Verb Oddities</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\n<strong>Can and May</strong>. The verb “can” shows ability or power; “may” is a modal verb involves permission or possibility. Examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> 'I can read' states a fact.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> 'May I read now?' seeks permission to read.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> 'That may be perfect' means 'It could be perfect.'</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Must. </strong>  Like 'can' and 'may' this is a 'modal verb.' The context of the sentence is important to understanding the meaning. <strong><em>Must</em></strong> can show an obligation or an opinion/assumption of the speaker.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> I <strong>must </strong>  call my pastor. In this case, <em>must </em>  indicates a responsibility.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He <strong>must</strong>  be overwhelmed with calls. In this sentence, <em>must</em>  indicates a strong assumption/belief about the person spoken of.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Has to. </strong>  This is another modal verb that must be considered in context. It can denote obligation, opinion/inference/assumption or need.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He has to finish the test. (Obligation)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He has to be nearly done. (Inference/assumption)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> He has to have insulin. (Personal need)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Teach and Learn</strong>. These verbs are partners. Teaching imparts knowledge. Learning means getting knowledge.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sit, Sat and Set</strong>. These verbs are often confused. “Sit” is used to convey resting or being seated. “Set” means to place something. “Sat” is the past tense for sit. “Set” stays the same in both present and past tense.

English has the first person pronouns ”I” and ”we” (Also: me, my, mine, us, our, ours).\n</p>\n<p>\nSecond person is how a speaker normally refers to the person or people he is speaking to. English uses the second person pronoun ”you” (Also: your, yours).\n</p>\n<p>\nThird person is how a speaker normally refers to someone else. English has the third person pronouns “he”, “she”, “it” and “they” (Also: him, his, her, hers, its, them, their, theirs).\n</p>\n<p>\nSometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to. See the examples of this from the Bible below. In some languages, first, second, and third person are shown with a prefix or suffix on a word. In some of these languages, using a pronoun in addition to the prefix or suffix indicates a special emphasis on the person or thing it refers to.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nDo what is natural and accurate in your own language. If your language does not always use a pronoun, do not use one simply because the source language does.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is important to note that sometimes in the Bible the text changes from writing in the first person to the third person, but still talking about the same individual. That might be unnatural and confusing in your language. If so, then translate with one or the other but maintain accuracy and clarity.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nSometimes people use the third person to refer to themselves or to the people they are speaking to.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen a person refers to himself in the third person, you may be able to add a first person pronoun for clarification. For example:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nBut David said to Saul, “Your servant used to keep his father’s sheep.”  (1 Samuel 17:34a, ULB)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nIn this example from 1 Samuel 17:34, David was speaking to King Saul about himself. He used the third person when he referred to himself as “your servant” and “his.” He was calling himself Saul's servant in order to show his humility toward Saul. \n</p>\n<p>\nIf it does not make sense in your language for someone to refer to himself in the third person, you could translate like this:\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nBut David said to Saul, “<em class=\"u\">I, your servant</em>, used to keep <em class=\"u\">my</em> father’s sheep.”  (1 Samuel 17:34a)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nIn this next example from Job, God speaks, first calling himself “I” then referring to himself in the third person with the words “God's” and “his.” He did this to emphasize the he is God and he is powerful. But if this does not communicate well in your language, you may need to use first person references in those places, such as, “mine.”\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n‘Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm: “Brace yourself like a man; <strong>I</strong> will question you, and you shall answer <em class=\"u\">me</em>. Would you discredit <em class=\"u\">my</em> justice? Would you condemn <em class=\"u\">me</em> to justify yourself? Do you have an arm like <em class=\"u\">God’s</em>, and can your voice thunder like <em class=\"u\">his</em>?”  (Job 40:6-9)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nSometimes people use the third person when referring to the people they are speaking to after they say “each of you.” Jesus used the second person when he called the group of people he was speaking to “<em class=\"u\">You</em> hypocrites.” However, after he said “each of  you,” he then used a third person pronoun (“his”) to refer to each of them. In those cases some languages might need to use a second person pronoun (“your”) in that place to keep the meaning clear.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nThen the Lord answered him, “<em class=\"u\">You</em> hypocrites! Does not <em class=\"u\">each of you</em> on the Sabbath untie <em class=\"u\">his</em> ox or <em class=\"u\">his</em> donkey from the manger and lead it away to water it?”  (Luke 13:15)</div></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from English</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nFirst person ~ “I gave the dog a bone.”<br/>\n\nSecond person ~ “You gave the dog a bone.”<br/>\n\nThird person ~ “She gave the dog a bone.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_abstractnouns\" title=\"Abstract Nouns\">Abstract Nouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_activepassive\" title=\"Active or Passive\">Active or Passive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_doublenegatives\" title=\"Double Negatives\">Double Negatives</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_ellipsis\" title=\"Ellipsis\">Ellipsis</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_exclusive\" title=\"Exclusive\">Exclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_you\" title=\"Forms of You\">Forms of You</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_youdual\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural\">Forms of 'You' - Dual/Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_yousingular\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Singular\">Forms of 'You' - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_youformal\" title=\"Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal\">Forms of 'You' - Formal and Informal</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_gendernotations\" title=\"Gender Notations\">Gender Notations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_genitivecase\" title=\"Genitive Case\">Genitive Case</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_grammar\" title=\"Grammar Topics\">Grammar Topics</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_inclusive\" title=\"Inclusive\">Inclusive</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_singularpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Singular\">Pronouns - Singular</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_pluralpronouns\" title=\"Pronouns - Plural\">Pronouns - Plural</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_rpronouns\" title=\"Reflexive Pronouns\">Reflexive Pronouns</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_quotations\" title=\"Speech Quotations\">Speech Quotations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_sentences\" title=\"Sentences\">Sentences</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/figs_order\" title=\"Word Order\">Word Order</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_verbs\" title=\"Verbs\">Verbs</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

If a language has two sets of pronouns for “we,” “us,” and “our,” choosing the correct word requires a clear understanding of who is being referred to by the pronoun.  Inclusive pronouns refer to the speaker, the person(s) being spoken to and possibly others as well. These pronouns are called “inclusive” because, in addition to the speaker, they include the person(s) listening. Exclusive pronouns are those which refer only to the speaker and a select group of individuals–not those to whom the comments are addressed.

When a translator sees the word “us,” they can use the word for “us” in their own language. But translators whose language has separate inclusive pronouns will always have to be careful whenever they read words like “we” “us” and “ours.” in English, Hebrew, or Greek. They will always have to figure out whether they should use the pronoun that includes the person being spoken to or the pronoun that excludes the person being spoken to.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\n… the shepherds said one to another, “Let <em class=\"u\">us</em>  go to Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to <em class=\"u\">us</em>.”  (Luke 2:15, WEB)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe shepherds were speaking to one another.

In English <strong>the reflexive pronouns</strong> are: myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, and themselves. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Functions of Reflexive Pronouns</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nReflexive Pronouns function in three different ways in English, that is, they do three different things:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Reflexive pronouns refer to a person or thing that has already been mentioned in the sentence.  For example, in the sentence “I saw myself in the mirror” the word “myself” refers back to “I” and in the sentence ”The man bought a new shirt for himself,” the word “himself” refers back to the “the man.” </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Reflexive pronouns can emphasize a person or thing in the sentence. A speaker may use a reflexive pronoun in this way because the person or thing may be doing something that the listener might not expect. This may also imply that the person or thing contrasts with something else.  For example, “Mary herself bought the food” emphasizes that it was Mary who did it, not someone else. Using a reflexive pronoun in this way is very common when correcting someone. For example, someone might say, “I think that Mary's father bought the book for her.” A response might be, “No, Mary bought the book <em class=\"u\">herself</em>.”</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Reflexive pronouns can state that someone did something alone or without help. For example, “Frank read the book by himself” could mean that Frank did it alone or that he did it without any help. The context will show which meaning is intended.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Translation Suggestions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Consider how your language indicates that something has already been referred to. Some languages may add something to the personal pronoun (as in English) or they may add a word to some other part of the sentence.<br/>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Languages have different ways of showing that a certain person or thing is being emphasized. They may or may not use a reflexive pronoun to do this. English also has other ways to show emphasis on a person or thing. “Jim <em class=\"u\">himself</em> paid the debt.” can be translated as, “It was Jim who paid the debt” or “Jim is the one who paid the debt” or “The one who paid the debt is Jim.” “Yesterday, Jim saw the king <em class=\"u\">himself</em>” can be translated as,  “Yesterday, it was the king that Jim saw” or “Yesterday, Jim <em>actually</em> saw the king.”<br/>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The idiom “by myself” could be translated as “alone,” “only,” or “without help,” depending on the context. “Bob went to the city <em class=\"u\">by himself</em>” can be translated as “Bob went to the city <em>alone</em>” or “<em>Only</em> Bob went to the city” or “Bob went to the city <em>without any help</em>,” depending on the context. </div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\n<strong>To refer to a person or object that has already been mentioned:</strong>\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nIf <strong>I</strong> should testify about <strong>myself</strong> alone, my testimony would not be true.

However people who looked at them later saw that there were small differences between them. Some copiers accidentally left out some words, and some mistook a word for another that looked like it. Occasionally they added words or even whole sentences, either by accident, or because they wanted to explain something.\n</p>\n<p>\nBible scholars have read many old copies and compared them with each other. For each place in the Bible where there was a difference, they have figured out which wordings are most likely correct. The translators of the ULB based the ULB on wordings that scholars say are most likely correct. Because people who use the ULB may have access to Bibles that are based on other copies, the ULB translators included footnotes that tell about some of the differences between them. \n</p>\n<p>\nTranslators are encouraged to translate the text in the ULB and to write about added sentences in footnotes, as is done in the ULB.

The storyline tells a series of events mostly in the time order that the events happened. It is full of action verbs that moves the reader along the storyline. Occasionally an author may take a break from the storyline to share something of interest. This break is called <strong>background information.</strong>  The underlined sentences in the story below are all background information.\n</p>\n<p>\nPeter and John went on a hunting trip because <em class=\"u\">their village was going to have a a feast the next day</em>. <em class=\"u\">Peter was the best hunter in the village.</em> <em class=\"u\">He once killed three wild pigs in one day!</em> They walked for hours through low bushes until they found  a wild pig. They shot the pig and killed it. Then they tied up its legs with some rope <em class=\"u\">they had brought with them</em>, and carried it home on a pole. When they brought it to the village, Peter's cousin saw the pig and realized that <em class=\"u\">it was his own pig</em>. <em class=\"u\">Peter had mistakenly killed his cousin's pig</em>.\n</p>\n<p>\nOften background information uses “be” verbs like “was” and “were”, rather than action verbs. Examples of these are “Peter <em class=\"u\">was</em> the best hunter in the village” and “it <em class=\"u\">was</em> his own pig.”\n</p>\n<p>\nSometimes the author makes a break in the story to tell about something that had happened earlier or something that would happen much later. Examples of these are “their village was going to have a a feast the next day” and “He once killed three wild pigs in one day,” “that they had brought with them,” and “Peter had mistakenly killed his cousins's pig.”\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>An author may use background information</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to help their listeners be interested in the story.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to help their listeners understand something in the story.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> to help the listeners understand why something is important in the story.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Reason this is a translation issue</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Translators need to know whether or not the events in the Bible happened in the same order that they are told. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Translators will need to translate the story in a way that their own readers will understand the order of events. </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Examples from the Bible</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nHagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

The second sentence is background information about how old Abram was when those things happened.\n</p>\n<blockquote><div class=\"no\">\nNow Jesus himself, when he began to teach, <em class=\"u\">was</em> about thirty years of age. He <em class=\"u\">was</em> the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli.  (Luke 3:23)</div></blockquote>\n<p>\nThe verses before this tell about when Jesus was baptized. This sentence introduces background information about Jesus’ age and ancestors. The story starts up again in chapter 4 where it tells about Jesus going to the wilderness.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Translation Strategies</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nTo keep translations clear and natural you will need to study the grammar and punctuation of your language.

But then Herod did another very evil thing. He had John locked up in prison.</strong>  (Luke 3:18-20) </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe underlined phrases happened before John rebuked Herod. In English, the helping verb “had” in “had done” shows that Herod did those things before John rebuked him.\n</p>\n<p>\n2. Reorder the information so that that earlier events are mentioned first.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Hagar gave birth to Abram's son, and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. <em class=\"u\">Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram</em>.</strong> (Genesis 16:16)</div>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> “<em class=\"u\">When Abram was eighty-six years old</em>, Hagar gave birth to his son, and Abram named his son Ishmael.” </div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>John also rebuked Herod the tetrarch <em class=\"u\">for marrying his brother’s wife, Herodias</em>, and <em class=\"u\">for all the other evil things that Herod had done</em>.

Those checks bring their work up to checking Level One. Then they need to have their work checked by others in order to meet the requirements of Level Two. For this, the translation team needs to bring their work to members of the language community and to the church leaders. This is necessary because the translation team is very close to and involved in their work, and so they sometimes do not see mistakes that others can see more easily. Also, other speakers of the language can suggest better ways of saying things that the translation team may not have thought of. Sometimes the translation team makes the translation sound strange because they are following the words of the source language too closely. Other speakers of the language can help them fix that. Also, the translation team may lack some of the expertise or knowledge of the Bible that others have, and so there may be some mistakes that others can correct for them. For those reasons, people that are not part of the translation team need to check the translation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe guidelines for how the translation team can do a check with members of the language community are in the Checking Manual, Volume One, as well as some guidelines for both the church leaders of Level Two and Level Three to follow when they check the translation. This volume contains further guidelines that the church leaders can use to guide them in checking the translation for both Level Two and Level Three. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_steps\" title=\"Steps in Checking a Translation\">Steps in Checking a Translation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

When you see something that you think might be a problem in the translation, do not make a statement to the translator that there is a problem in the translation. If you do not speak the target language, then you do not know if there is a problem or not. You only suspect that there could be a problem. Even if you do speak the target language, it is more polite to ask a question than to make a statement that something is wrong. You could ask something like, “What would you think about saying it this way?” and then suggest an alternative way to translate it. Then together you can discuss the different translation ideas. If you do not speak the target language, you must only ask questions. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Explore the target language and culture</strong>.  The questions that you ask will be to discover what the phrase means in the target language. The best questions are the ones that help the translator to think about what the phrase means and how it is used. Useful questions are, “In what situations is this phrase used in your language?” or “Who usually says things like this, and why do they say it?” It is also useful to help the translator to think about what a person from his village would say if in the same situation as the person in the Bible. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <strong>Teach the translator</strong>. After you explore the meaning of a phrase in the target language and culture, you can tell the translator what the phrase means in the source language and culture. Then together you can decide if the phrase in the translation or the phrase he has just thought of has that same meaning or not.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h4 >Checking the Translation Directly</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIf you speak the target language, then you can read or hear the translation and ask the translation team about it directly. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Using a Written Back Translation</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIf you do not speak the target language, you will need to work from a back translation in a language that you do understand. This can be written separately from the translation, or it can be written as an interlinear, that is, with a line of back translation written under each line of the translation. It is easier to compare the translation to the back translation when they are written as an interlinear, and it is easier to read a back translation that is written separately. Each method has its own strength. The person who makes the back translation should be someone who was not involved in making the translation.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If possible, review the back translation in written form before meeting with the translator or translation team face-to-face. This will give you time to think about the passage and to do further research on questions that arise because of what the back translation says. It will also save a lot of time when you meet with the translation team, because there will be a lot of text that you do not need to talk about because you read it in the back translation and it did not have problems. When you meet together, you will be much more productive because you can spend all of your time on the problem areas.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> As you work through the back translation, make notes of questions that you want to ask the translator, either for clarification or to help the translator think about possible problems with the translation. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Also ask the translator for a copy of the translation (if it is not interlinear), so that you can compare the translation with the back translation and make note of the connectors that the target language uses and other features that might not be visible in the back translation. Looking at the translation can also help to identify places where the back translation might not accurately represent the translation, for example, where the same words are used in the translation but they are different in the back translation. In this case, it is good to ask the translator why the back translation is different, and if it needs to be corrected. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If you cannot review the back translation before meeting with the translator, then work through it with the translator, discussing questions and problems as you work together. Often, as the back translation is compared to the translation, the translator will also discover problems with the translation.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h4 >Using an Oral Back Translation</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIf there is no written back translation, then have someone who knows the target language and also a language that you understand make an oral back translation for you. This should be a person who was not involved in making the translation. As you listen to the oral back translation, make notes of words or phrases that seem to communicate the wrong meaning or that present other problems. The person should translate the passage in short segments, pausing in between each segment so that you can ask your questions after you hear each segment. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >After Checking</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSome questions will need to be set aside for later, after the checking session. Be sure to plan a time to meet again to discuss the answers to these questions. These will be:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Questions that you or someone else will need to research, usually something about the biblical text that you will need to find out, such as more exact meanings of biblical words or phrases, or the relationship between biblical people or the nature of biblical places.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Questions to ask other speakers of the target language. These would be to make sure that certain phrases are communicating correctly, or to research the cultural background of certain terms in the target language. These are questions that the translation team may need to ask of people when they return to their community.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Key Words</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nMake sure that the translation team is keeping a list of the translationWords - the important terms - from the Bible passages that they are translating, along with the term in the target language that they have decided to use for each of these important terms. You and the translation team will probably need to add to this list and modify the terms from the target language as you progress through the translation of the Bible. Use the list of translationWords to alert you when there are Key Words in the passage that you are translating. Whenever there is a Key Word in the Bible, make sure that the translation uses the term or phrase that has been chosen for that Key Word, and also make sure that it makes sense each time. If it does not make sense, then you will need to discuss why it makes sense in some places but not in others. Then you may need to modify or change the chosen term, or decide to use more than one term in the target language to fit different ways that the Key Word is used. One useful way to do this is to keep track of each important term on a spreadsheet, with columns for the source language term, the target language term, alternative terms and the Bible passages where you are using each term. We hope that this feature can be included in future versions of translationStudio.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation\" title=\"Back Translation\">Back Translation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

It is called a “back translation” because it is a translation back in the opposite direction than what was done to create the local target language translation. A back translation is not done in a completely normal style, however, because it does not have naturalness as a goal in the language of the translation (in this case, the language of wider communication). Instead, its goal is to represent the words and expressions of the local language translation in a literal way, while also using the grammar and word order of the language of wider communication. In this way, the translation checker can most clearly see the meaning of the words in the target language text, and can also understand the back translation well and read it more quickly and easily. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation_purpose\" title=\"The Purpose of the Back Translation\">The Purpose of the Back Translation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Therefore, the language of the back translation needs to be a language that both the person doing the back translation (the back translator) and the checker understand well.  Often this means that the back translator will need to translate the target language text back into the same language of wider communication that was used for the source text. \n</p>\n<p>\nSome people might consider this to be unnecessary, since the biblical text already exists in the source language. But remember the purpose of the back translation: it is to allow the checker to see what is in the target language translation. Just reading the original source language text does not allow the checker to see what is in the target language translation. Therefore, the back translator must make a new translation back into the language of wider communication that is based only on the target language translation. For this reason, the back translator <em>cannot</em> look at the source language text when doing his back translation, but <em>only</em> at the target language text. In this way, the checker can identify any problems that might exist in the target language translation and work with the translator to fix those problems. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe back translation can also be very useful in improving the target language translation even before the checker uses it to check the translation. When the translation team reads the back translation, they can see how the back translator has understood their translation. Sometimes, the back translator has understood their translation in a different way than they intended to communicate. In those cases, they can change their translation so that it communicates more clearly the meaning that they intended. When the translation team is able to use the back translation in this way before they give it to the checker, they can make many improvements to their translation. When they do this, the checker can do his checking much more rapidly, because the translation team was able to correct many of the problems in the translation before meeting with the checker. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation_who\" title=\"The Back Translator\">The Back Translator</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

He will usually do this one sentence at a time, or two sentences at a time if they are short. When the translation checker hears something that may be a problem, he will stop the person doing the oral back translation so that he can ask a question about it. One or more members of the translation team should also be present so that they can answer questions about the translation.\n</p>\n<p>\nAn advantage of the oral back translation is that the back translator is immediately accessible to the translation checker and can answer the translation checker’s questions about the back translation. A disadvantage of the oral back translation is that the back translator has very little time to think about the best way to back translate the translation and he may not express the meaning of the translation in the best way. This may make it necessary for the translation checker to ask more questions than if the back translation were expressed in a better way. Another disadvantage is that the checker also has very little time to evaluate the back translation. He only has a few seconds to think about one sentence before hearing another. Because of this, he may not catch all of the problems that he would catch if he had more time to think about each sentence.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Written</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThere are two types of written back translations. The differences between the two will be discussed in the next module. A written back translation has several advantages over an oral back translation. First, when a back translation is written, the translation team can read it to see if there are any places where the back translator has misunderstood their translation. If the back translator misunderstood the translation, then other readers or hearers of the translation certainly will misunderstand it also, and so the translation team will need to revise their translation at those points. \n</p>\n<p>\nSecond, when the back translation is written, the translation checker can read the back translation before meeting with the translation team and take time to research any question that arises from the back translation. Even when the translation checker does not need to research a problem, the written back translation allows him more time to think about the translation. He can identify and address more of the problems in the translation and sometimes come to better solutions to the problems because he has more time to think about each one than when he has only a few seconds to think about each sentence. \n</p>\n<p>\nThird, when the back translation is written, the translation checker can also prepare his questions in written form before meeting with the translation team. If there is time before their meeting and if they have a way to communicate, the checker can send his written questions to the translation team so that they can read them and change the parts of the translation that the checker thought to be problems. This helps the translation team and the checker to be able to review much more of the biblical material when they meet together, because they were able to fix many of the problems in the translation before their meeting. During the meeting, they can concentrate on the problems that remain. These are usually places where the translation team has not understood the checker’s question or where the checker has not understood something about the target language and so thinks that there is a problem where there is not. In that case, during the meeting time the translation team can explain to the checker what it is that he has not understood. \n</p>\n<p>\nEven if there is not time for the checker to send his questions to the translation team before their meeting, they will still be able to review more material at the meeting than they would have been able to review otherwise because the checker has already read the back translation and has already prepared his questions. Because he has had this previous preparation time, he and the translation team can use their meeting time to discuss only the problem areas of the translation rather than reading through the entire translation at a slow pace, as is required when making an oral back translation. \n</p>\n<p>\nFourth, the written back translation relieves the strain on the translation checker from having to concentrate for many hours at a time on hearing and understanding an oral translation as it is spoken to him. If the checker and translation team are meeting in a noisy environment, the difficulty of making sure that he hears every word correctly can be quite exhausting for the checker. The mental strain of concentration increases the likelihood that the checker will miss some problems with the result that they remain uncorrected in the biblical text. For these reasons, we recommend the use of a written back translation whenever possible.\n*\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation_written\" title=\"Kinds of Written Back Translations\">Kinds of Written Back Translations</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

This results in a text in which each line of the target language translation is followed by a line in the language of wider communication. The advantage of this kind of back translation is that the checker can easily see how the translation team is translating each word of the target language. He can more easily see the range of meaning of each target language word and can compare how it is used in different contexts. The disadvantage of this kind of back translation is that the line of text in the language of wider communication is made up of translations of individual words. This makes the text difficult to read and understand, and may create more questions and misunderstandings in the mind of the translation checker than the other method of back translation. This is the same reason we do not recommend the word-for-word method for translation of the Bible!\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Free Back Translation</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nA free back translation is one in which the back translator makes a translation in the language of wider communication in a separate space from the target language translation. The disadvantage of this method is that the back translation is not related as closely to the target language translation. The back translator can overcome this disadvantage when back translating the Bible, however, by including the verse numbers with the back translation. By referring to the verse numbers in both translations, the translation checker can keep track of which part of the back translation represents which part of the target language translation. The advantage of this method is that the back translation can use the grammar and word order of the language of wider communication, and so it is much easier for the translation checker to read and understand. Even while using the grammar and word order of the language of wider communication, however, the back translator should remember to translate the words in a literal way. We recommend that the back translator use the method of free back translation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation_guidelines\" title=\"Guidelines for Creating a Good Back Translation\">Guidelines for Creating a Good Back Translation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Show the Target Language Usage for Words and Clauses</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n</div>\n<h4 >a. Use the meaning of the word in context</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIf a word has only one basic meaning, then the back translator should use a word in the language of wider communication that represents that basic meaning throughout the back translation. If, however, a word in the target language has more than one meaning, so that the meaning changes depending on the context that it is in, then the back translator should use the word or phrase in the language of wider communication that best represents the way that the word was used in that context. In order to avoid confusion for the translation checker, the back translator can put the other meaning in parentheses the first time that he uses the word in a different way, so that the translation checker can see and understand that this word has more than one meaning. For example, he might write, “come (go)” if the target language word was translated as “go” earlier in the back translation but in the new context it is better translated as “come.” \n</p>\n<p>\nIf the target language translation uses an idiom, it is most helpful to the translation checker if the back translator translates the idiom literally (according to the meaning of the words), but then also includes the meaning of the idiom in parentheses. In that way, the translation checker can see that the target language translation uses an idiom in that place, and also see what it means. For example, a back translator might translate an idiom such as, “he kicked the bucket (he died).” If the idiom occurs more than once or twice, the back translator does not need to continue to explain it each time, but can either just translate it literally or just translate the meaning. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >b. Keep parts of speech the same</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIn the back translation, the back translator should represent the parts of speech of the target language with the same parts of speech in the language of wider communication. This means that the back translator should translate nouns with nouns, verbs with verbs, and modifiers with modifiers. This will help the translation checker to see how the target language works. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >c. Keep clause types the same</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIn the back translation, the back translator should represent each clause of the target language with the same type of clause in the language of wider communication. For example, if the target language clause uses a command, then the back translation should also use a command, rather than a suggestion or request. Or if the target language clause uses a rhetorical question, then the back translation should also use a question at that point, rather than a statement or other expression. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >d. Keep punctuation the same</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe back translator should use the same punctuation in the back translation as there is in the target language translation. For example, wherever there is a comma in the target language translation, the back translator should also put a comma in the back translation. Periods, exclamation points, quote marks, and all punctuation need to be at the same place in both translations. In that way, the translation checker can more easily see which parts of the back translation represent which parts of the target language translation. When making a back translation of the Bible, it is also very important to make sure that all chapter and verse numbers are in the right places in the back translation.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >e. Express the full meaning of complex words</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSometimes words in the target language will be more complex than words in the language of wider communication. In this case, the back translator will need to represent the target language word with a longer phrase in the language of wider communication. This is necessary so that the translation checker can see as much of the meaning as possible. For example, to translate one word in the target language it might be necessary to use a phrase in the language of wider communication such as, “go up,” or “be lying down.”   Also, many languages have words that contain more information than the equivalent words in the language of wider communication. In this case, it is most helpful if the back translator includes that additional information in parentheses, such as “we (inclusive),” or “you (feminine, plural).” \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >2. Use the Language of Wider Communication Style for Sentence and Logical Structure</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe back translation should use the sentence structure that is natural for the language of wider communication, not the structure that is used in the target language. This means that the back translation should use the word order that is natural for the language of wider communication, not the word order that is used in the target language. The back translation should also use the way of relating phrases to each other and the way of indicating logical relations, such as cause or purpose, that are natural for the language of wider communication. This will make the back translation easier to read and understand for the translation checker. This will also speed up the process of checking the back translation. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_things_to_check\" title=\"Types of Things to Check\">Types of Things to Check</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

This can be difficult if there is not a tradition of writing or spelling in the target language. It is even more difficult when several people are working on different parts of the translation, and they have different ideas about how to spell words. For that reason, it is important for the translation team to meet together before they start translating to talk about the writing system that they will use, and how they plan to spell words. \n</p>\n<p>\nThere will be some words that are easy to spell, and other words that are difficult. Discuss the difficult words as a team. If you find that the difficulty is because the words have sounds in them that are difficult to represent, then you may need to discuss a change in the writing system that you are using. It may be that you need to modify one or more symbols to represent the difficult sound. If the difficulty is because there are different ways that the sounds can be represented and the members of the team have different ideas about how to represent the sounds, then you will need to discuss this and come to an agreement. Then it can be helpful to make a list, such as on a spreadsheet, of these difficult words. Put these words in the list in alphabetical order, spelled in the way that you have decided to spell them. Make sure that each member of the translation team has a copy of the list, so that they can consult it when translating. Add to the list as you come across more difficult words, and make sure that each team member has a current list. It usually works best if one person keeps the master list and regularly distributes it to the others. \n</p>\n<p>\nSome of the most difficult words to spell consistently in any language are the names of people and places in the Bible. This is because many of them are strange and unusual in most target languages. Be sure to include names on your list of difficult words.\n</p>\n<p>\nComputers can be a great help for checking spelling. If you are using MS Word for a Gateway Language, it will probably have a dictionary already loaded and will check the spelling for you. If you are translating into an Other Language, you can use the find/replace feature to find words that are spelled wrong and replace them with the correct spelling. If you are using Sovee, it will suggest words as they were spelled the first time that they were used. You can accept that spelling, or correct it. If you correct it, Sovee will learn the new spelling and suggest that to you in the future. If you are using translationStudio, we recommend that you export your translation and import it into ParaTExt. Then run the spell checking feature in ParaTExt, and it will find all variant spellings of words. It will present these to you and then you can choose which spellings you have decided to use.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/punctuation\" title=\"Consistent Punctuation\">Consistent Punctuation</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Examples include the indicators of pauses such as the comma or period and the quotation marks that surround the exact words of a speaker. In order for the reader to be able to read and understand the translation correctly, it is important that you use punctuation consistently. \n</p>\n<p>\nBefore translating, the translation team will need to decide on the methods of punctuation that you will use in the translation. It may be easiest to adopt the method of punctuation that the national language uses, or that a national language Bible or related language Bible uses. Once the team decides on a method, make sure that everyone follows it. It may be helpful to distribute a guide sheet to each of the team members with examples on it of the correct way to use the different punctuation marks. \n</p>\n<p>\nEven with the guide sheet, it is common for translators to make mistakes in punctuation. Because of this, after a book has been translated, we recommend importing it into ParaTExt. You can enter the rules for punctuation in the target language into ParaTExt, then run the different punctuation checks that it has. ParaTExt will list all of the places where it finds punctuation errors and show them to you. You can then review these places and see if there is an error there or not. If there is an error, you can fix the error. After running these punctuation checks, you can be confident that your translation is using punctuation correctly.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/verses\" title=\"Complete Versification\">Complete Versification</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

For more information about this, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_textvariants\" title=\"Textual Variants\">Textual Variants</a>. Your translation team will need to decide whether you will include these verses or not.\n - <strong>Different Numbering</strong> - Some Bibles use a different system of verse numbering than other Bibles. For more information about this, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_chapverse\" title=\"Chapter and Verse Numbers\">Chapter and Verse Numbers</a>. Your translation team will need to decide which system to use.\n - <strong>Verse Bridges</strong> - In some translations of the Bible, the contents of two or more verses are rearranged so that the order of information is more logical or easier to understand. When that happens, the verse numbers are combined, such as 4-5 or 4-6. The UDB does this sometimes, and on rare occasions, also the ULB. Because not all of the verse numbers appear or they do not appear where you expect them to be, it might look like some verses are missing. But the contents of those verses are there. For more information about this, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/translate_versebridge\" title=\"Verse Bridges\">Verse Bridges</a>. Your translation team will need to decide whether to use verse bridges or not.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Checking for Missing Verses</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIn order to check your translation for missing verses, after a book has been translated, import the translation into ParaTExt. Then run the check for “chapter/verse numbers.” ParaTExt will give you a list of everywhere in that book that it finds verses missing. You can then look at each of those places and decide if the verse is missing on purpose because of one of the three reasons above, or if it is missing by mistake and you need to go back and translate that verse.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/headings\" title=\"Section Headings\">Section Headings</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Section headings are like titles to each section of the Bible that begins a new topic. The section heading lets people know what that section is about. Some Bible translations use them, and others do not. You may want to follow the practice of the Bible in the national language that most people use. You will also want to find out what the language community prefers.\n</p>\n<p>\nUsing section headings requires more work, because you will have to either write or translate each one, in addition to the text of the Bible. It will also make your translation of the Bible longer. But section headings can be very helpful to your readers. Section headings make it much easier to find where the Bible talks about different things. If a person is looking for something in particular, he can just read the section headings until he finds one that introduces the topic that he wants to read about. Then he can read that section.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you have decided to use section headings, then you will need to decide which kind to use. Again, you will want to find out which kind of section heading the language community prefers, and you may also choose to follow the style of the national language.  Be sure to use a kind of section heading that the people will understand is not part of the text that it introduces. The section heading is not a part of scripture; it is just a guide to the different parts of scripture. You might be able to make this clear by putting space before and after the section heading and using a different font (style of letters), or a different size of letters. See how the Bible in the national language does this, and test different methods with the language community.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Kinds of Section Headings</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThere are many different kinds of section headings. Here are some different kinds, with examples of how each one would look for Mark 2:1-12: \n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Summary statement: “By healing a paralyzed man, Jesus demonstrated his authority to forgive sins as well as to heal.” This tries to summarize the main point of the section, and so it gives the most information in a full sentence.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Explanatory comment: “Jesus heals a paralyzed man.” This is also a full sentence, but gives just enough information to remind the reader which section follows.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Topical reference: “Cure of a paralytic.” This tries to be very short, only giving a label of a few words.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Question: “Does Jesus have authority to heal and forgive sins?” This one creates a question that the information in the section answers. People who have a lot of questions about the Bible may find this especially helpful.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> “About” comment: “About Jesus healing a paralyzed man.” This one makes it explicit that it is trying to tell you what the section is about. This may be the one that makes it easiest to see that the heading is not a part of the words of scripture.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAs you can see, it is possible to make many different kinds of section headings, but they all have the same purpose. They all give the reader information about the main topic of the section of the Bible that follows. Some are shorter, and some are longer. Some give just a little information, and some give more. You may want to experiment with the different kinds, and ask people which kind they think is most helpful for them.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/checking/community_evaluation\" title=\"Language Community Evaluation Questions\">Language Community Evaluation Questions</a></em>\n</p>\n</div>"

Over the many years of development and experimentation, certain truths have been discovered that have come to be considered “principles” of sound, many of these relating to the physics of sound. As principles were learned, inventors steadily created technology designed to capture and reproduce sound in varying degrees of faithfulness and character to the live sound source.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe audio recording we are thinking about in this manual does not happen in laboratory conditions of science halls or the technical design room. Instead, it happens in a dynamic, diverse real-world environment with each scenario a unique condition, each recording a unique, creative, human expression.\n</p>\n<p>\nReal audio recording cannot be reduced to a technical or mechanical process. In truth, real audio recording is the craft of a creative artist applying wisdom, skills, proven principles and careful technique to the unique ingredients of the environment, the available tools and the characteristics of the people participating.\n</p>\n<p>\nunfoldingWord understands this distinction and seeks to encourage and empower the global Church's new and existing audio recordists to become ever wiser and better skilled at their craft. Likewise, we are equally and always students of audio. So we eagerly look forward to what the global church will continue to teach us and allow us to pass along in the free and open context.\n</p>\n</div>"

It refers to the what the recording quality enables for effective distribution. Does it have the flexibility and versatility needed for various applications? Excellence also refers to how a project is done in regard to relationships. Did the work and interactions bring about positive things in God's family?

It is easy for beginners and experienced recordists alike to become intrigued with all of the gadgets and digital processing available in audio recording today. However, keeping things simple is not only our recommended approach, but also the wisest approach in nearly every recording scenario. In fact, things rarely go wrong when the equipment and process is kept simple. By contrast, every additional piece of equipment, cable adapter, processing step, logistical complication, extra participants, etc. that is not a necessary element increases the likelihood for errors, problems, project down time, stress and discouragement.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn regard to equipment, a basic setup will be the most reliable, each piece designed and tuned to do its task well. Every piece is compatible with the other pieces and with the context of the project. No unnecessary pieces of equipment, cables or software processes are taking up space or creating the increased potential for problems.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn regard to the team, a small team that is committed to the project, understands their roles and works as a team will likely have excellence in their efforts. Having too many staff or participants involved can often introduce new complications to the project and decrease efficiency.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_equipment_setup\" title=\"The Equipment Setup\">The Equipment Setup</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_setup_team\" title=\"The Team\">The Team</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Gaining, sharpening and maintaining skills takes effort and time investment. However, for a recordist working toward excellence, there is great joy and appreciation for learning, strengthening and improving skills. In fact, a wise recordist not only enjoys learning, but sees it as an important, continual process.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome people assume that upgrading to more expensive, advanced-level equipment will be a fast and easy substitute for skills. In reality, advanced-level equipment is typically more challenging to use properly, especially for people that never gained basic skills in the first place. Also, expensive equipment typically means increased complexity in the recording setup, which works against the principles discussed in the Simplicity module.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother frequent misconception is that “IT” or “Tech” skill sets are an automatic substitute for audio/media creation skill sets. Perhaps this idea comes from observation that technology is used, but technology is used in most professions across the world. For example, no one would consider a skilled IT person to be an automatic substitute for a doctor simply because the doctor uses technical equipment. The IT person could discern much about the operation of the equipment but would not automatically possess the necessary knowledge, intuition and techniques a doctor creatively and skillfully provides to meet the unique needs of each patient. Many technical-minded people do have creative art and relational skills as well, but it is important to understand that IT and Media Creation skill sets are not the same. Audio recording is a creative process, not a mechanical or technical process.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe approach that has strength for the dynamic, interpersonal creative process of audio recording is anchored in skills, not equipment. Skills live on when the equipment fails. Skills know what to do when troubleshooting is needed. Skills recognize when the equipment is working fine but the recording is not coming together properly. Skills know how to adapt to the best alternative solution. Skills are sensitive to the dynamics of the creative process, hour by hour. Skills find and build upon the unique strengths of each team member. No piece of equipment can do these things and a technical understanding of the mechanics is not sufficient.\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause skills training is so important, much of the content of this handbook is dedicated to skills training on essential audio principles.

The recordist must gain the necessary process, technical and interpersonal skills for:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> creating media in a team setting,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> leading the recording process with wisdom,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> operating and maintaining the equipment,</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> ensuring excellence in recording and editing steps, and</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> making sure recording standards are being followed and met, including backing up audio data.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIn addition, the recordist often is the greatest servant and encourager to the rest of the team, sensing their needs and helping them succeed in their roles.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe recordist must also make, or suggest many decisions in real-time related to recording and editing that will impact the quality of the recording and the efficiency of the project. The view of unfoldingWord is that these two things, quality and efficiency, are not conflicting opposites as they are often believed to be. Instead, making proactive decisions toward quality will naturally result in efficiency.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn many ways, the recordist has a significant influence on the morale and attitude of the team, as well as the overall experience of the recording project. A happy, pleasant, patient, humble recordist is a great blessing to the rest of the team members, each of them also having challenging responsibilities. Remember most narrators and checkers will have less experience with the recording process and may not be confident in the beginning. Your encouragement and gentle guiding will mean a lot. A team that is happy and feeling appreciated and encouraged will produce an excellent project.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne thing a recordist can do to really strengthen the team is to make sure that he/she does not work in a way that places a technology barrier between themselves and the rest of the team. Too often in recording settings, viewing sound waves on the screen is thought to be only for the recordist. Instead, we suggest that in many contexts a team that can see, understand and communicate together based on what is happening with the sound waves on the computer screen will be a team that works more effectively together.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe recordist makes sure the equipment is of the right design, sets up the equipment properly and ensures that all team members, including themselves, are using good technique.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe recordist also must evaluate the recording environment before and during the recording process, providing solutions for any acoustical challenges that are present.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe recordist should also have the courage, and courtesy, to address recording problems right away in a kind manner. There is no benefit to allow bad recording to happen that will need to be re-done later. It is much better to stop recording for a moment, fix the problem, and then record with quality.\n</p>\n<p>\nNot always, but many times the recordist will be the one that must pay close attention to the well-being of the team and learn to recognize their limits. For example, the recordist may need to suggest it is time for a short tea break when it is clear that the narrator is feeling fatigued or everyone has just struggled through a challenging section of recording. A few minutes spent recharging physically and relationally will keep the overall productivity stronger.\n</p>\n<p>\nPrayer is something that should be part of the project and life of the team everyday. Pressing the red record button as quickly as possible each morning is not more urgent that spending a few moments together with the Lord as a team.\n</p>\n<p>\nLastly, the recordist, especially those early in their learning, should take a moment to send a recorded sample via email or Dropbox to unfoldingWord or to a mentor for constructive feedback. This is an excellent way to learn in real-life scenarios, improve the excellence of the recording and potentially save the entire team from wasting a lot of time recording badly. Obviously, getting feedback at the beginning of the project is much more beneficial that waiting until later in the project.\n</p>\n</div>"

The responsibility of the narrator is to clearly communicate the words of the text (or oral translation). The narrator must not only say the correct words, but the words must also be said the right way. In many languages, words or phrases said in the wrong way (mispronounced, incorrect tone, incorrect emphasis on a syllable) can change the meaning of the message communicated to the listener.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnyone involved in a recording project should spend a few moments in the position of narrator to gain an appreciate and understanding of how challenging this role is. Few people are able to narrate even short passages on the first try without making errors. A good narrator will build upon any natural skill they have and train further at their ability to read accurately with making few mistakes (fixing mistakes is where a lot of time can be consumed on a project).\n</p>\n<p>\nA narrator should have a clear voice that is comfortable to listen to for extended periods. He or she must be a native speaker of the language they are recording and must not have lost their pure accent due to living away from communities where the language is spoken daily.\n</p>\n<p>\nConsistency in the sound of the narrator's voice is important not only for the listeners but also for the recording and editing processes. A narrator must read using their natural voice, not attempting to sound like someone else.\n</p>\n<p>\nCan the narrator be old, young, man or woman? The answer is that cultural values should be respected and taken into consideration when selecting the right narrator(s) for a project. Pastors or other ministry leaders in the people group would have the best understanding of the cultural values and help identify the right kind of person to communicate Biblical content in their culture.\n</p>\n<p>\nAvoid having a popular person serve as narrator based only on their popularity or prestige. Being a popular figure in the community does not mean they have the right skills to be a narrator. A good way to identify the best narrator is to record samples of several different candidates. Assign a number to each sample file. Have local leaders listen to each file and identify the file number that has the narrator that is best to listen to. This helps identify the best narrator based on skill and quality of voice, not popularity or prestige.\n</p>\n<p>\nA narrator must also consider the varying education levels and listening needs of a diverse audience. Therefore, it is best to narrate at a slow-to-mid level speed. Avoid reading too fast. \n</p>\n<p>\nAs mentioned above, the narrator must be a native speaker of the language. To define that more, they must be familiar with the correct pronunciation and meaning of the words in the text. He or she must be able to give the correct intonations and sound consistent, confident and natural, not speaking in a manner that conveys doubt, uncertainty or guessing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe narrator must also obey punctuation marks correctly in the text. Failure to do so can cause the listeners to understand the meaning of the message differently than the written text was carefully punctuated to communicate.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnother valuable skill of a narrator is the learned ability to minimize the negative impacts of their breathing during narration. Of course, the narrator must breathe and be relaxed and comfortable during the recording process. But narrators can sharpen their skills at breathing in a quieter and more controlled manner. This decreases the amount of editing work for the recordist and will be more comfortable for listeners. Our opinion is that the soft sound of the narrator breathing between phrases does sound natural and is not distracting. By contrast, loud breathing or apply heavy silencing effects during the editing phase creates a significant degree of distraction to the listener. Therefore, a good narrator can make a very positive impact on a recording by breathing skillfully.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne way to help the narrator perform well is to record the text in small portions, rather than lengthy sections. This can help not only with accurate narration, but also with good breathing technique.\n</p>\n</div>"

Any encouragement and support the checker can give will be much appreciated by the narrator.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere will likely be many situations during a recording where the checker and narrator will need to assess a word or phrase for accuracy.

Field recording includes the traditional concept of recording in a remote location, but would simply be defined as any temporary setup that creates a quality recording environment where a suitable one did not previously exist.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is the our belief that field recording is how most Biblical content will need to be recorded. It is often too expensive to build, maintain and staff fixed infrastructure. Likewise, the high costs and logistical constraints of utilizing established, professionally designed studios can often be prohibitive. However, a field recording team is skilled, mobile and adaptable. A good field recording team enables recordings to happen where they need to happen.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Skills &amp; Ingenuity</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nOften field recording requires much in the area of skills and ingenuity from the recording team, especially the recordist. The recordist needs to be able to assess the existing recording environment, detect elements that will negatively impact quality and identify locally-available solutions that will handle those issues. In order to do this effectively, the recordist needs to have a solid understanding of the behavior of sound waves in an environment and how to treat or avoid common issues.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Simplicity</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nKeeping the recording process and equipment setup simple is one of the smartest decisions that can be made in field recording. A simple kit of gear means it is easy to maintain, easy to setup, and there is less chance for problems, errors or delays. Skill at knowing how to use that gear very well will produce better results than having fancy gadgets.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Adaptability</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAdaptability has as much to do with a resilient attitude as it does with the ability to adjust in areas of equipment, logistics or process. A team with proper skills-training and a simple gear setup is able to be adaptive when circumstances change and Plan A is no longer viable. The ability to quickly adapt, create and succeed with excellence at Plan B or Plan C can often be necessary in field recording.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdvantages of a field recording can be:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Recording can be done in the best location possible considering all factors of project.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Ability to record at or near where the language is spoken can make the difference in being able to record or not (cost and cultural advantages).</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> A team is assembled for the specific project, which can help increase focus and intentionality.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Intentionality by the recordist to select optimal equipment may lead to an easier recording and better quality.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Intentionality by the recordist to analyze and treat acoustical challenges can create an environment equal or better than any studio alternatives.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nDisadvantages of field recording can be:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Nearly every factor of recording becomes a variable that the recordist must find a solution for.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Some locations can be extremely challenging to find an environment quiet enough for recoding.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> There may be a need to setup and pack away equipment and workspace every day, which may reduce time spent recording.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_assessing_recording_space\" title=\"Assessing the Recording Space\">Assessing the Recording Space</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_acoustical_treatments\" title=\"Simple Acoustical Treatments\">Simple Acoustical Treatments</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

              "text": "<h2 class=\"sectionedit1\" >Basic Acoustic Principles</h2>\n<div class=\"level2\">\n<p>\n<em>This page answers the question:</em> <em>What are basic acoustic principles?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the helpful steps towards recording with excellence is understanding basic concepts about the behavior of sound waves in a recording environment. A recordist with basic knowledge can make profound improvements in quality and clarity of the narration, often with very little investment of time, energy or material cost.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe first principle to know about acoustics is that, even though sound waves are invisible, their behavior is not unpredictable. In fact, their behavior can be easily explained, measured and calculated with mathematical formulas. This is not something the average recordist will be interested in or need to calculate so we will not devote space toward it in this module. Most recordists will only need to understand that there is an objective reason why sound behaves the way it does in a recording space and, with basic knowledge, they can be confident in knowing how to improve it.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second principle to know about acoustics is that, in truth, when we take steps to improve the sound quality we are actually applying subtractive measures, not additive. In other words, we are not making it sound better by adding new ingredients that are good. Instead, we are making it sound better by decreasing ingredients that sound bad, thus allowing the good ingredients to be heard with more clarity and comfort.\n</p>\n<p>\nOften what we are really solving, or overcoming, by this subtractive improvement technique is to bring a more natural balance back to the sound that has been artificially impacted by the recording environment.\n</p>\n<p>\nA third principle about acoustics is that sound waves contain energy and will stay active (producing noise) until there is something that depletes their energy to the level of being non-detectable for the human ear. Generally speaking, acoustical challenges are caused by physical conditions that make particular sound frequencies be strong, thus throwing off the desirable balance of frequencies. The dimensions of a recording space will impact the balance, or imbalance, of frequencies.\n</p>\n<p>\nVirtually every type of material provides some degree of absorption of sound, which is something that may not be obvious. What we really need to know is how well a particular material absorbs certain frequencies. For example, a glass window is some what effective at absorbing low bass frequencies, but it is very poor at absorbing mid-range and high frequencies. Therefore, in a voice recording context, glass is not going to be a very useful treatment material because it does poorly at absorbing the frequencies that are problematic in voice recording. By contrast, a wool or cotton blanket, even a single layer of thickness, can provide a significant degree of sound absorption of troublesome mid-range and high frequencies.\n</p>\n<p>\nGlass typically amplifies acoustical problems because it acts as a large, hard reflective surface to bounce sound waves back and forth with other hard surfaces, such as cement walls. Sounds waves reflecting off hard surfaces are perhaps the main acoustical challenge faced in voice recording.\n</p>\n<p>\nDeflection of sound waves is another technique to reduce reflections, yet it has a less significant effect. Deflection is typically used more when trying to keep a controlled level of reflection. It is our opinion that for beginning recordists, deflection will not be the best technique. Absorption should be the primary technique used. However, anything that can be done to absorb or scatter (deflect) sound waves will almost always be advantageous.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe last principle to know about acoustical challenges is that they must be tackled before you record, not after. There is a common assumption that software can fix acoustic issues in a recording. The reality is that some things can be adjusted by software, but there are many acoustical issues that cannot be removed from a recording later. Any attempt to do major fixing will usually degrade the entire recording, including the good aspects that need to be preserved. This can be very expensive and time consuming for only a minimum degree of effectiveness. The bottom line is that recordists need to solve acoustical issues on site before recording, not hope there will be expensive software and expert engineers able to fix it later.\n</p>\n</div>"

Instead the recordist is going to need to rely on their ears and their eyes as their best tools to assess a recording space.\n</p>\n<p>\nAn easy way to give a potential recording space an initial assessment is to simply say a few phrases aloud and listen to how your voice sounds in the room. Does it sound clear and natural? Do you notice an echo? Does it sound like your voice has an unusual characteristic? Repeat this test in various locations in the room and facing in different directions. Do you find different results depending on where you stand or which direction you face? Is there a specific location and direction that sounds the clearest and most natural?\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce you identify the best location, the next step is to make some simple acoustical improvements to make the voice sound even better.\n</p>\n<p>\nHow can we use our eyes to effectively assess the recording space and identify probable sources of acoustical problems? Even with just a small amount of training and experience, you can notice things that are acoustical challenges ready to happen. Bare cement walls and ceilings, tile floors, large glass windows, metal doors – these are physical materials that have a reputation for reflecting sound waves at a problematic level.\n</p>\n<p>\nBefore beginning to make acoustical improvements, there are few more aspects to evaluate about a potential recording space. Are there activities that typically occur in an adjacent room, on the floor above, or outdoors nearby? Is it possible that at certain times of the day or week the recording environment could be a drastically different situation than the exact time that you are assessing it? For example, an evening or weekend visit to assess a recording space may not give an accurate representation of what the ambient noise level is like during regular working hours.\n</p>\n</div>"

This is good news, since professionally manufactured acoustic foam is quite expensive and not easy to obtain in many parts of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\nOne of the first steps toward acoustic treatment is to utilize existing furnishings such as chairs, beds, rugs, curtains, tapestries, shelves of books and many other common items that may already be in the room or in the house or facility. In fact, you will probably notice the rooms that sound the best are often the ones with furniture absorbing and deflecting sound waves. It is our recommendation to use these common furnishings to your advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat kinds of things can be done to improve a decent sounding room even further? Hanging blankets on the walls and placing a linen on the table that the narrator is using can significantly reduce echo reflections. Other ideas include positioning pillows near the microphone or a suitcase with towels or linens inside just beyond the microphone in order to immediately absorb sound.\n</p>\n<p>\nA word of caution needs to be mentioned, however, against taking acoustical treatment to the extreme. If too much treatment is used, such as covering all surfaces with carpet or foam, the room will lack the natural vibrancy that a voice should have. The result is that the sound of the voice seems unnaturally dry, dull and flat. So use good judgment when approaching acoustical treatment. Be sure to address the problems before you record, but do not go so extreme that you create a new acoustical problem.\n</p>\n<p>\nAfter we have made simple improvements that make the room sound better, it is time to make sure our work has been as effective as we believe it is. When recording, a microphone hears, with great sensitivity, what is occurring acoustically in the recording environment. Therefore, what really matters is what the microphone is hearing.\n</p>\n<p>\nAssuming you are using a correctly designed mic as discussed in the Microphones module, it would be an excellent next step to record a few test samples and carefully listen with a set of quality headphones. Quality headphones will tell the truth about what the microphone is hearing and you can take further acoustical treatment steps if needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_assessing_recording_space\" title=\"Assessing the Recording Space\">Assessing the Recording Space</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_mic_recommended\" title=\"Recommended Mics\">Recommended Mics</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_recommended_headphones\" title=\"Headphones\">Headphones</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

They are unequaled in their performance and capability to perform any recording, editing and file management task required during a project. Typically, these will have a larger screen and the ability to utilize keyboard and mouse commands, all of which aids in productivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Note about other operating systems for laptops:</em> We have not focused on other <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> platforms in this manual for the following reasons. Apple Mac laptops are excellent for recording but are typically far too expensive and unfamiliar for many end-users within the global Church. Linux is very cost effective but not familiar for most end-users. Initial testing has been done on laptops utilizing Chrome <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr>. While the hardware appears suitable for quality recording, it lacks a fully functional, offline recording software adequate for voice recording. Therefore, Chrome is not considered a practical solution for recording at this time.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Tablets (Android OS)</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAndroid is by far the most predominate operating system for tablets today with numerous manufacturers and broad global distribution. These can typically be purchased at a much lower cost than a Windows <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> laptop. Besides cost savings, one of their chief advantages is portability (at the compromise of screen size and the other factors that boost productivity and efficiency).\n</p>\n<p>\nA fully-functional, free recording/editing software (WavePad Free) exists for Android <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr>, with other apps being developed specifically for use in oral translation projects. While software is not a limiting factor for Android devices, most manufacturers are not building their devices with quality audio hardware inside. There are 2 primary hardware issues with Android devices that are not detectable without hands-on testing to discover what provision for audio the manufacture included in the device.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany tablets are not equipped with a 3.5 mm TRRS jack, which means that it cannot record with an external microphone (built-in mics usually produce very poor quality). Even if it does have a TRRS jack, the majority of tested tablets were discovered to have poor quality analog to digital converters, which are necessary to convert the captured sound to digital data. Typically there is a significant amount of static and noise in the recorded sound due to the poor quality converters.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Handheld Portable Recorders</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nSmall, battery-powered handheld digital recorders have become popular in recent years and wide variety of models are offered by many manufacturers of electronic equipment. These devices often include a set of basic recording and playback controls, an LCD screen user-interface, the ability to listen to recorded material on the device and the ability to name files. Many of these have extremely long battery life, record to an SD card or can connect directly to a laptop as a USB mic.\n</p>\n<p>\nPortable recording devices offer some conveniences, but they usually come with various tradeoffs that limit versatility and negatively impact other steps of a project. Generally speaking, the portable recording device will inevitably require the use of another recording device to do the majority of the audio project work. The best use for a portable device would be a circumstance where it is not possible to have any other equipment where the recording will happen. While there are circumstances in voice recording where this could be the right choice, it is our suggestion that the vast majority of these devices are ill-suited for the task of voice-recording in sub-optimal conditions. For example, nearly every model available has omni-directional condenser mics (often 2 or more of them) which is probably the worst possible design for recording voice narration in sub-optimal settings.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_recommended_recording_devices\" title=\"Recording Devices\">Recording Devices</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

However, in simple recording projects studio monitors are unlikely to be available, so any kind of small speaker that can provide good playback listening for the recording team could be considered a monitor.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Cables</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThere are a variety of cables that may be used for transferring the audio signal to headphones or monitors. The following types of cables may be used:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> TRS Y-Adapter cable – These cables split the audio into 2 pathways. These may be used in order to connect two sets of headphones or a set of headphones and a monitor. These will typically be 3.5mm TRS.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> TRRS Y-Adapter cable – These split the signal when connecting both a mic and a set of headphones to a single TRRS 3.5mm jack on a tablet.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Power Equipment</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWhile not specifically a piece of audio equipment, there is always a need for electrical power for the recording device, which often will not have enough battery life to last a full day of recording without needing to be recharged. There are several ways to provide for this need.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Electrical service - It is a good idea to include an outlet strip and extension cord with the audio equipment for charging the recording device when/if electrical service is available. Be sure to have the correct plug on the outlet strip or an adapter to the local socket configuration.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Backup Battery – this can be in the form of a second laptop battery that can be changed. Or, in the case of a tablet, an external battery can be connected via miniUSB to recharge the tablet while in operation.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Solar – with some technical expertise, a solar panel system can be utilized to charge batteries for additional power supply.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_recommended_equipment\" title=\"Recommended Equipment\">Recommended Equipment</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

A workspace that is laid out well helps to bring the team together and make the work flow effective. A poorly configured workspace can cause the team to feel disconnected and make many repetitive tasks take longer.\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause every workspace will be different across the world, we cannot speak specifically to each scenario. What we can do is provide key concepts that we consider when laying out a workspace. These concepts can then be applied by the recording team to their unique recording environment.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Organized &amp; Tidy</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWe recommend laying out a workspace that is easy to keep organized, clean and tidy. Of course, people must maintain it and care for it. But the layout often sets a tone for how people decide, and are able, to maintain it. Here are some suggestions:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Layout the equipment and positions of the team so that cables are not stretched across areas where people must walk or in ways that make a desk messy.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> In advance, make provision for equipment like headphones, notepads, pens, etc. to have a “home”. This helps prevent items from being lost or damaged.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Minimize Distractions</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAvoid placing the narrator in a position where there are many visual distractions, such as facing a window, a doorway or a door with a window. They will be too easily distracted by other activities happening nearby.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Minimize Acoustical Challenges</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThere are certain locations in a room that will typically be prone to more acoustical challenges than others. Avoiding these locations when positioning the narrator and the microphone's listening direction can help decrease acoustical challenges. Generally speaking, these are locations to avoid:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Near to a wall</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Near a window</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The exact center of a square or rectangular shaped room.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Visual Connectivity</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nPerhaps one element that draws a team together and helps their work flow more than anything else is the visual communication within the team and in interaction with the display of the audio waveform. Unless a circumstance proves otherwise, we tend to discourage traditional layouts where:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> the recordist has exclusive view of the screen where the audio file and waveform are displayed.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The recordist and the narrator are in separate rooms.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nInstead, positioning the team in the same room with open visual communication with each other and with the audio data can give the team a better sense of truly working together as a team and making the best use of time and information.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit6\" >Suitable furniture</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nRecording projects require many hours of patient work, so it is important that the team is comfortable and able to work productively. Provisions might include comfortable chairs and a small desk or table. There should also be enough lighting, natural or lamp, for the team to read text without straining their eyes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>One special note about chairs:</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nBe careful of chairs that swivel, rock or have metal legs and casters. These may contribute unwanted sounds to your recording. Quite naturally, if chairs swivel, rock or have metal pieces, someone on the team will be making their chair squeak, creak or clank accidentally.\n</p>\n</div>"

If you are using an omni-directional mic you will likely spend all day adjusting and never find an ideal position, with every position yielding poor results. If you are using an omni-directional mic, it is important to stop and ask yourself why you are doing that. Save yourself the experience of a tremendous amount of difficulty and decreased quality throughout the project by exchanging that omni-directional mic for a reliable unidirectional mic.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> It is always an excellent idea to use a pop filter or windscreen with a mic. These are a minimal expense and can even be improvised to a degree of effectiveness if needed. A pop filter will disperse the force of wind that moves with too much strength on some letters and syllables, causing distorted or thudding noises in the recording. These are called plosives. Most narrators will not have voice training to help them control plosives, so it is important to use a pop filter or other counter measures to prevent a recording full of plosives, which can be very unappealing for future listeners.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe mic placement begins by considering the various physical and audible factors of the recording space and the narrator. Other sections of this manual should have helped you get the recording space into good recording condition. Our work now involves positioning the narrator and the mic in ways that make maximum benefit of the acoustical treatment.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Initial Placement</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThere are three fundamental considerations that determine the initial mic placement.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> The narrator should be positioned in a location where his/her voice can project sound in a direction that is prepared to handle (and reduce, not increase) reverberation and echo.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Where is the front of the mic pointing? This is the sensitive side. It should be pointing toward the sounds you want to capture.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Where is back of the mic pointing? This is the side that is not sensitive to sound. It should be pointing toward any sound sources you want to block out of the recording. Many people forget about this secret weapon. A wise recordist will leverage the sound rejecting characteristic of the back of the mic just as strategically as the sound capturing front side.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Find the Narrator's Comfortable Position</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nEspecially in a field recording scenario where there is less permanent furniture and fixtures, it is important to have the narrator settle in to a comfortable position, typically seated, but standing is acceptable and reportedly may improve breathing and projection of voice. However, a standing narrator may tend to move around more, which will create increased difficulty in maintaining a consistent recording level. For this reason and many others, most narrators perform their work from a seated position. When referring to a seated position, this is specifically a comfortable, yet attentive posture. Slouching or hunching over is not a good position for the narrator.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Bring the Mic To the Narrator</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nHave the narrator get comfortable first, then move the mic into position. If the mic is positioned first, the narrator will likely not find it located in comfortable posture and will move around.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe mic (including pop filter) should be about one hand width away from the narrator's mouth and slightly offset to be out of the direct force of the wind from their voice. If the mic is placed too far away the result will be a thin sound and low recording volume, which means the mic will need to be amplified more, which will also make it more sensitive to background sounds. This creates unnecessary problems that will negatively impact the recording process and quality. Likewise, if the narrator is getting too close to the mic, the audio signal will be recorded too strong, resulting in distortion and popping noises in the audio track.\n</p>\n</div>"

              "text": "<h2 class=\"sectionedit1\" >Setting the Mic Gain Level</h2>\n<div class=\"level2\">\n<p>\n<em>This page answers the question:</em> <em>How is the mic gain level set properly?</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nThere is perhaps no single step in the entire process that affects every aspect of the project (and distribution of the audio resource for years) more than properly setting the mic gain level. It is often misunderstood how greatly this simple step at the beginning impacts the required time investment, post-production and the quality level of the final result. Improper gain level setting creates editing and production challenges that in many cases are not repairable.\n</p>\n<p>\nFortunately, setting a proper gain level is one of the easiest things to do and only takes a couple minutes. The proper level is always a careful balance of three variables:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> mic preamp level</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> loudness of narrator's voice</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> distance of the narrator from the mic</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >About the Mic Preamp Level</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nEvery mic is paired with a preamp, which may be in the form of a dedicated external preamp device, an audio interface, a mixing console channel preamp, a computer sound card or built into the mic. On a practical level, adjusting the gain level will be done either with an analog control knob on a device, by adjusting the sound settings in the computer control panel settings, or both. It is generally good advice to never set any preamp level to 100%, as it can add electronic noise into the recorded signal. If it seems that setting at 100% is necessary, it may be an indicator that one of the other three variables is not set right or that you are using equipment not designed for voice recording applications.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy contrast, if you find the need to set a level at 10% or “slightly on”, you are probably using a setup with multiple gain staging and at a different stage in the signal path, the gain is set too high. Operating at either extreme is not a good idea, with risk of added noise or a recorded signal that is thin and does not replicate the quality produced in the live environment. Multi-gain level systems should be avoided if possible due to the added complexity, the exception being a mic such as the Zoom H2n (please read module on setting up the Zoom H2n).\n</p>\n<p>\nOur recommendation is to operate within the range of 25%-75% on equipment level settings.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >About the Loudness of the Narrator's Voice</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe loudness of a narrator's voice will vary from person to person. Furthermore, a narrator's voice may vary at different times of the day and at different energy levels (the characteristic sound of a person's voice can also vary throughout the day). What is more important than targeting a specific volume is that the narrator's voice must sound natural. Asking a narrator to speak louder than they are comfortable with will produce a noticeably unnatural feel to the recording. By contrast, asking a loud narrator to read quiet could yield a result that sounds lifeless or weak.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile making sure the voice sounds natural and comfortable is very important, people with extremely soft or extremely loud voices can present challenges to recording well. An excessively quiet voice will probably necessitate very high gain settings on equipment, which increases ambient and electronic noise levels in the recording. An excessively loud voice can easily sound like shouting and even create additional echoes and other acoustical challenges to deal with.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe best idea is to encourage the narrator to use a steady, natural voice that is comfortable for them and can be sustained throughout recording sessions.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >About Distance of the Narrator From the Mic</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWhile the unknown variables of the type of mic and the narrator's natural-voice loudness level prevent the ability to specify an exact distance, we recommend using the width or length of a hand (10 - 20 cm) as a general distance to start with when setting the gain level.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >The Process of Setting the Level</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nOur goal is for the signal level of the narrator's voice to register at approximately -6dB. We will need to adjust the gain sensitivity level to accomplish this.\n</p>\n<p>\nCreate a new file and begin recording. Have the narrator practice speaking at their natural volume level a hand-length away from the mic, with the mic volume set to 50%. Observe the amplitude level of the recording, In rare cases, the volume will be consistently higher than -6dB. If so, keep adjusting the gain level lower until you have a proper recording volume. In many cases, the test recording volume level will be inadequate. If that is the case, follow these steps in the following order of priority.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Make sure the narrator is positioned comfortably and is projecting their voice to the best of their ability while still sounding natural. Sometimes beginning narrators might be reading softly for lack of confidence in a new and unfamiliar role. Other times they may not realize that they can project their voice a little louder while still sounding natural and feeling very comfortable. Be very kind and encouraging throughout the process of reaching the optimal vocal output. If the test recording volume level is still low, proceed to step 2.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Make sure the narrator is actually maintaining a hand-length distance from the mic. Many beginning narrators might gauge their distance initially, but within seconds adjust their posture for comfort or to be able to view the text more easily. Suddenly they are not a hand-length away, but even up to a forearm length away. Make sure they are in a comfortable position and can view the text easily. Then watch to make sure the narrator is keeping the correct distance consistently. If these things are correct and the test volume level is still low on the recording, proceed to step 3.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> As explained earlier in the module, we can often turn the mic preamp gain up to about 75% without inducing too much background or electronic noise. Begin increasing the mic preamp gain level up towards 75% until you have reached the target level in the test recording.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/audio/audio_setup_h2n\" title=\"Zoom H2n Setup (USB mode recording)\">Zoom H2n Setup (USB mode recording)</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

An audio recording with an excellent signal to noise ratio will have the narrator's voice clear in the foreground of the audio track, with little or no hiss or static noise in the background. By contrast, a poor signal to noise ratio will be characterized by very noticeable static noise and hiss competing with the narrator's voice. A recording with a significant amount of distracting background noise from the local environment could also be considered an example of poor signal to noise ratio.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur goal is to record the narrator's voice (signal) at a quality level (-6dB) while having the background noise as quiet of possible.

These fair results will be refined in a matter of minutes in the process described below.\n</p>\n<p>\nListen to the test track on some quality headphones and observe the levels registering on the meter in your software. What do you notice about the audio quality? What did you notice about the noise floor? Was it sufficiently quiet, hopefully around -55dB? Was the narrator reaching -6dB?\n</p>\n<p>\nIf any of your responses are not satisfactory, there is still some fine-tuning needed. If there is too much echo, try repositioning the mic or improving your acoustical treatment. If the narrator was too loud, you can decrease the mic gain level. If the noise floor was too strong, you will need to turn the gain level down and have the narrator stay closer to the mic.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe suggestions in the paragraph above are solutions we might try if we were at the recording project. However, one of the valuable skills that the recordist must develop is taking all of these principles into account and determining what the best solution is in their unique circumstance. It is impossible for us to provide a universal solution in this manual without knowing what is actually occurring at the recording site. Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions if you are struggling to achieve a quality recording level with a quiet noise floor.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Acclimating Process</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nYou can expect that at the beginning of the recording project or session, the narrator is still getting warmed up and acclimated to the experience of recording. As they become more confident in the process, their volume level may change slightly. This is normal and it will be up to the recordist, as it is at all times during the recording, to make sure the narrator is using good technique and that the mic gain level is set properly.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Note about Proximity Effect</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nIn general, condenser mics do not exhibit proximity effect (USB mics and TRRS mics are condenser mics and thus do not have proximity effect). However, due to their design, professional dynamic mics have a characteristic called proximity effect where bass frequencies become much stronger when the narrator gets very close to the mic. Not every dynamic mic exhibits this characteristic to the same degree.\n</p>\n<p>\nProximity effect could be good or bad, depending on the result the recording team is seeking. For example, some people in radio broadcast find the enhanced bass to be a signature sound. However, this effect is often safely managed by experienced audio engineers in professional studios to ensure that the impact is not detrimental to the quality.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy contrast, in the simple field recording scenario, too much bass can create at least 2 problems for the recording project. First, too much bass can reduce the clarity of the voice, which hurts the listening appeal of the recording. An effort to offset that problem when the recording is processed for distribution will often reveal the second problem. So much of the sound that was originally captured was actually excessive bass, which carries more sound energy than mid and high frequencies. This means that reducing bass also significantly reduces the overall volume level of the recording. To address the reduced volume level, the track must then be amplified, which increases the noise floor, sometimes to an excessive level. The end result is that even though the recordist believed that the recording level was good during the recording, the truth was that too much of the sound level was actually excessive bass, not quality voice sound.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you record using a dynamic mic (which we do not discourage because they actually have beneficial characteristics and they are very durable), we recommend keeping the principle of proximity effect in mind as you set your recording level. Listen to your recording right away. If there is so much bass that it is reducing the clarity of the narrator's voice, you should take steps to minimize this impact. One simple way to reduce the proximity effect is to angle the mic so the narrator is not speaking directly into the front of the mic capsule.\n</p>\n</div>"

This is especially important as time passes and recording projects become more numerous, distribution versions are created, the focus of the recording work evolves, etc. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe recommend creating a master folder called Audio, Audio Projects or something similar. Inside of this folder, we recommend using subfolders according to language, project type, or whatever you find to be the best organizational structure for your projects. The main idea is that your audio-related files are always saved in a master audio folder. If all your work is in this folder, rather than scattered in different locations, it is easy to locate files, keep adding more subfolders in a logical manner, and keep your entire audio folder backed up.\n</p>\n</div>"

These markers are used to indicate special points or boundaries in the audio track.\n</p>\n<p>\nMarkers can be used for any purpose that the recordist believes will be helpful. These are some common uses:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Identifying the start of a new section of audio, such as a frame in Open Bible Stories or a verse in Scripture.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Identifying a section of audio that needs to be fixed or reviewed.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Identifying a point of progress in the review process.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Types</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nMost software programs that permit markers will allow two different types of markers, which can be used for different purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"audio_ocenaudio_marker_types.jpg\" class=\"media\" src=\"assets/img/ta/audio_ocenaudio_marker_types.jpg\" title=\"audio_ocenaudio_marker_types.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Point Marker</strong> - A Point Marker identifies a single point in the time line. These are more often used for identifying sections of audio, such as verses or OBS frames. Ocenaudio gives point markers a yellow flag at the top.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Region Marker</strong> - A Region Marker identifies a region of audio in the time line marked with start and end boundaries. This type is often used to identify a section of audio that needs further attention for editing or review. Ocenaudio gives region markers a red flag at the top and red vertical boundary lines.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Placement</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nPoint markers can be placed in the audio track in the following ways:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Pressing the assigned keyboard shortcut key. The marker will be placed in the audio at the location of the play cue. The play cue can be placed in a location by clicking in the waveform. Point markers can also be placed while the audio file is recording or playing.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Clicking in the waveform to choose location for marker. Then click on the Edit Menu and select Create Marker.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nRegion markers are identified with a red flag and can be placed by clicking in the waveform and selecting a range of audio.

The boundaries of region markers can be adjusted by clicking on the red flags and dragging to the desired location.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Deleting Markers</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nCaution must be used when choosing to delete point markers in Ocenaudio because the auto-numbering system will continue advancing to the next sequential number, even if a marker number is deleted. It is recommended to move markers to the correct location rather than delete them. To delete a point marker, simply right click on the yellow flag and select “Delete Marker”.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo delete a region marker, simply right click on the red flag and select “Delete Region”. In Ocenaudio, region markers are not related to the auto-numbering of point markers.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit6\" >Naming Markers</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nMany software programs auto-name point markers. For example, Ocenaudio automatically names markers as they are placed as Marker 1, Marker 2, Marker 3, etc. The name of the marker can be viewed by moving the cursor over the flag on the marker. We recommend using the auto-naming to your advantage for a simple way to identify verses or OBS frames. This saves time manually naming the markers. If necessary, you can rename a marker by hovering the cursor over the marker name and clicking on it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"audio_ocenaudio_marker_label_name_edit.jpg\" class=\"media\" src=\"assets/img/ta/audio_ocenaudio_marker_label_name_edit.jpg\" title=\"audio_ocenaudio_marker_label_name_edit.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n</div>"

In addition, the following ideas are worth considering to help the recording process.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Begin your day of work with time spent in prayer as a recording team. The recording is not so important or so urgent that there is no time to spend a few minutes with the Lord as a team.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Don't push too hard in recording. When it is evident that taking a break will help the team recharge, take a short break.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> A happy team will be more productive and work in much better unity together, which is really valuable when faced with difficult recording circumstances or passages. Discover how to enjoy working together and valuing each other. It will help greatly.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Some passages will be more difficult to narrate due to the phrasing or the presence of Proper Names or unusual words. Do not hesitate to make those difficult areas into smaller sections for recording. Struggling through long sections of difficult reading can be discouraging and there is no reason to do that. Instead, gain confidence and momentum by making the difficult passages into small pieces to record.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Have the narrator preview the text before the recording session begins. This will give the narrator an opportunity to consider how to read certain passages properly, perhaps even making notes on when to pause, which passages to read as smaller sections, etc.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Some passages will have unfamiliar Proper Names or words that are more complicated pronounce. Take time to identify them and determine the proper pronunciation in advance of recording. Pronunciation guides are available in some languages and the narrator or checker can make notations to aid the narrator in proper pronunciation during the recording.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>One last tip….</em> Save your work often. Don't wait to save your progress until you reach the end of a story or chapter. You can lose a lot of hard earned progress if the file is not saved when the recordist makes a serious error, the electricity goes off or a software program crashes.\n</p>\n</div>"

Any editing will quickly add time invested on that 1-minute piece of audio. Without good discernment about when to edit and when to re-record, 10 or even 15 minutes could go by trying to fix a small error that could have been re-record and resolved in much less time.\n</p>\n<p>\nMost of the time a re-recorded section that does not need to be edited will be of much better quality that a section that required complex editing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere will, of course, be situations when it makes sense to spend a little extra time editing. However, most of the time inexperienced recordists will spend too much time editing sections of audio that should be re-recorded. Do your best to be aware of this risk and strengthen your skills for assessing when to edit and when to re-record.\n</p>\n</div>"

Recordings should also have approximately 1 second of silence at the beginning and end of the recording. While many software programs offer an effect that places an adjustable amount of absolute silence where you would like to in the timeline, we recommend against using this feature. The reason is that these “silence” areas will not match the general feel of the rest of the recording. Those spots will seem awkward, almost as if a vacuum sucked all of the sound away momentarily.\n</p>\n<p>\nInstead of using the silence feature, we recommend a technique that maintains the natural feel of the recording.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> In the recorded file, simply find a quiet pause in the audio that represents the natural ambient sound and is free of any random sounds such as the narrator moving in his chair or taking a breath.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Copy this section and paste it in place where you need more pause or silence.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Playback again to make sure the amount added gave the right length of natural pause. Adjust as needed by pasting more or deleting excess.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nNote: Avoid the assumption that there is a standard length for pauses between sentences (for example 0.7 seconds). Each language is unique and so is each narrator and the speed at which they are narrating. The correct length of the pause must always be natural and is determined by the speakers of the language in the context of that narrated recording.\n</p>\n</div>"

Such actions are clearly illegal and, beside the ethical implications of doing things that way in ministry, there are potential ramifications for recipients of restricted content. In some countries, breaking copyright law is a criminal offense.

Would it not be much better for God's family to work together in a way that did not require our brothers and sisters to break the law or be dishonest in agreements with one another? This is not a problem created by the laws of governments. Instead this is a problem created by choosing a license that legally restricts and controls access to Biblical content. This is something that occurs unnecessarily within God's global family. Governments are only enforcing the license terms that were chosen.

It is very easy to make a copy of the audio resource that is at the optimal file size for the end-user.\n</p>\n<p>\nGenerally speaking, in order to make the file size smaller for distribution, you will need to decrease the quality of the audio. This change is permanent. For example, when creating a standard quality MP3 file from a WAV master file, 80% of the audio quality is permanently deleted. This process cannot be reversed. Before you begin making smaller-sized, lower quality copies for distribution, make sure that you:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> have saved a backup copy of your master files</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> are following a process that makes a new set of files in the lower quality format. Do not permanently convert your high quality source files to low quality!</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf you did a quality job making decisions during your recording and editing phases, you will have much greater ability to maintain good listening quality even when making the file sizes small for distribution.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome recording software allows you to “batch process” or “batch convert” a group of files together at one time to a format setting for distribution. This saves a tremendous amount of time over creating a distribution version manually, one file at a time.\n</p>\n<p>\nMP3 format is the most widely compatible format for distribution. Please refer to the File Format Standards module for the latest information on the file format settings we recommend for distribution.\n</p>\n<p>\nInstructions for using a free format conversion software for WIN <abbr title=\"Operating System\">OS</abbr> can be found in the Guides Section.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >File Renaming</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThere may be reasons to rename a copy of an audio resource for distribution purposes (do not rename the master files).

Mobile phones:\n</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"audio_mobile_phone.jpg\" class=\"media\" src=\"assets/img/ta/audio_mobile_phone.jpg\" title=\"audio_mobile_phone.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> are not limited to the infrastructure of electrical grids, telephone lines or internet.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> are by far the most common personal electronic device capable of playing audio.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> most can accept a microSD card.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> can receive or send files by a built-in short range radio signal called Bluetooth.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> many can connect to local WIFI networks to send or receive data.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> many are capable of audio and video playback.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIt is certainly an incredibly powerful tool for listening to audio resources and sharing them with others. With billions of mobile devices already owned and used by people across the world, they are extremely cost effective for listening to audio content (assuming content is in the correct format for the type of phone and the license permits distribution and sharing).\n</p>\n<p>\nFor all of the benefits of smart and basic mobile phones, there are also many misconceptions and limitations that may not be obvious depending on your own experience in your own cultural context. Below are some examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Not every person, or even every family has a mobile phone.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Not every person is familiar with how to read and navigate digital menus on a mobile phone.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Most people do not have smartphones and cannot make use of smartphone apps.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Many people do not have ready access to electricity to recharge their mobile phone regularly, which means that using it as an audio player depletes the valuable battery life rapidly.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Many phones do not have a quality built-in speaker for listening with a small group of people or while working in the field, for example.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Many phones do not have menus that allow for fast, easy navigation around larger audio resources, such as OBS, NT's or Full Bibles. This is especially true for people less skilled with technology.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> For people that young, old, blind, disabled or are among the 1 billion non-readers, it may be very challenging or impossible to use a mobile device without someone else operating it for them.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Personal mobile phones are not usually shared or given away to other people or other communities in the way that a Bible or audio Bible player is shared or given away.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIt is important to realize that most of the people who historically and presently do not have good access to Biblical content in their language are also unlikely to be able to access content through smartphone apps or internet streaming. It is easy to make an incorrect assumption of which technology best fits the local needs if decisions are based on your own cultural experience or on the marketing and advertising of other ministries.\n</p>\n</div>"

The ministry organizations have taken into consideration the many challenging contexts across the world in which people want to be able to listen to Biblical content and have designed players to meet that criteria. An example of device designed for an incredible level of versatility, durability and utility is the MegaVoice Envoy S player. The Envoy S is approximately the size and shape of a basic mobile phone and has many features highly tuned to the needs of recording teams, ministry leaders and end-users. Some of these features include:\n</p>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"audio_megavoice_envoy.jpg\" class=\"media\" src=\"assets/img/ta/audio_megavoice_envoy.jpg\" title=\"audio_megavoice_envoy.jpg\"/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Field programmable via miniUSB </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Tamper proof onboard memory</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Extremely durable (proven to withstand being crushed by heavy vehicles and machinery and keep playing)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Can withstand hot, cold, wet and dry climate conditions.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Includes built-in speaker for individual or small group listening</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Headphone jack for private listening</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Built-in solar panel for recharging long-life, lithium-ion battery</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> MiniUSB port for additional charging options including power adapter, laptop USB port or other charging technology</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Intuitive, tactile touch navigation buttons make navigation around any audio content such as Scripture, stories, or lessons very easy, especially the book, chapter verse structure of Biblical content.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> End-user can bookmark their location at the end of a listening session</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Can play continuously for hours on a single charge.</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nA feature set such as this on an audio player can provide a tremendous degree of needed flexibility, intuitiveness and self-sufficiency valued by ministry leaders, families and communities alike.\n</p>\n<p>\nDedicated audio players offer many advantages over options like mobile phones or radios, but they also have disadvantages that should also be considered. Typically, these audio players are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> not readily available in many local areas, making the hardware more difficult to obtain and service locally (typically done through regional networks)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> require a financial investment upfront, typically by an outside mission-minded church or organization able to absorb the costs that would otherwise be too expensive for many end-users</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIt is important to mention that organizations creating audio players are not doing so in order to “sell hardware” as a lucrative money making idea. That idea is far from the truth. On the contrary, designing, testing and manufacturing field-worthy devices is an incredibly difficult and expensive task. The equipment is optimized for the needs, is more durable than consumer-grade electronics and is expensive to make on a smaller scale compared to mass-produced, cheap electronics. Accomplishing all of this and making these available at a mission-minded price point requires great commitment to wanting people to be able to hear God's message in their own language.\n</p>\n<p>\nWithout these audio players, many people would not be listening to Biblical content. This is especially true when considering that the vast majority of Biblical audio content currently has restricted-license terms applied by the copyright owner. Audio players have successfully bridged a difficult legal and relational problem, serving as a tangible, measurable representation of “a copy” that complies with license terms.\n</p>\n</div>"

Opening the case gives access to a 3.5mm stereo input cable that connects the speaker to an audio player. A second cable is included and is a bi-directional charging cable. Utilizing the included adapters, an audio player or mobile device can be recharged from the case speaker battery. Likewise, the included standard USB A adapter cable allows the case speaker to be rapidly charged from a laptop USB charging port or other 5VDC source.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe speaker is capable of being very loud and, in an enclosed room, can provide listening coverage for dozens, perhaps even a hundred people.

Instead there are two important design characteristics of microphones that play the biggest role in determining the suitability for voice recording, particularly in sub-optimal conditions. It is worth noting that the visible shape or size of a mic is not a valid indicator of the suitability of a mic. Instead, it is the design properties of internal components that determine the behavior and performance of a mic. Let's take an inside look at the designs for signal transfer method and direction of sensitivity.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Signal Transfer Method</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nSignal transfer method is not a description any microphone manufacturer uses, but it is a good way to think about the design aspect that registers sound waves and converts them to an electronic signal passed through wires and eventually to the recording device. There are nearly a dozen designs that do this, but only two of them are widely used in the voice recording context this manual is intended to support so we will only focus on those two.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Dynamic</strong> - This is a more robust design that relies on sound waves vibrating a thin piece of material, which then moves a coil of wire in close proximity to a magnet, thus generating electrical current in the wires. Dynamic mics are a very solid design that are often characterized as more durable, yet less sensitive than the other common design.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Condenser</strong> - This is a design that makes use of a thin material (diaphragm) that is always electrically charged. When sound waves cause it to vibrate, it makes small changes to the electric field between the diaphragm and a nearby metal plate, thus creating electrical current. This design requires an external DC power source to electrically charge the diaphragm. While dynamic and condenser designs have some general similarities, the constantly charged diaphragm of the condenser design is much more sensitive to sound waves, including an increase in sensitivity to high frequencies. Condenser mics are considered to be more fragile that dynamic mics. However, many designs are quite durable and condensers have become the design chosen in nearly all consumer electronic devices manufactured today, including mobile phones.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Direction of Sensitivity</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nOften described as a mic's polar pattern, there are many different designs for how strongly a mic senses (hears) or rejects sound from different directions. There are three major classifications for polar patterns, only one of which we recommend using for voice recording.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unidirectional</strong> – Sensitive on one side. This design is best for voice recording. Examples of this design include cardiod, hypercardioid, supercardioid patterns.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Omnidirectional</strong> – Equally sensitive from all directions. Not good for voice recording.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bi-directional</strong> – Equally sensitive on two opposite sides. Not good for voice recording.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Connectivity Types</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nMicrophones are available with a variety of connections. The mics are designed to be compatible with the standard electrical specifications of the intended connecting interface or device. Below we will identify the most common types of connections that consistently produce the best results, are the most reliable and versatile, and are the easiest to use for the task of audio recording.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >XLR Connection</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThis is the most common connection type for professional quality microphones and will typically produce the very best audio quality. Of all the connection types, it is most likely to have the highest cost for required equipment. However, the ease of use and efficiency for the recording projects is unparalleled by other options, which may be a valuable consideration especially for larger projects such as Scripture recording.\n</p>\n<p>\nXLR mics cannot connect directly to a laptop or tablet. They require the use of an intermediate device called an audio interface. Audio interfaces typically connect to a laptop by USB connection or Firewire connection. Most interfaces provide the recordist with intuitive analog controls for adjusting mic gain levels and playback listening volume.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >USB Connection</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nUSB Mics have are becoming more popular because of the simplicity of connecting directly to a computer. Originally having poor audio quality, many professional mic manufacturers are beginning to produce USB mics capable of excellent sound quality. Currently, the tradeoff for direct connectivity to a computer can be the loss of simple analog controls for both mic gain and playback volume. For many USB mics, these controls are now contained in digital menus in the mic or in the computer control panel settings. In some cases, recording software includes shortcuts to make adjustments, although sometimes these are actually a secondary adjustment, and if coupled with settings on the USB mic, creates multiple locations where levels are being regulated, which adds complexity.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur testing and research for using USB mics with Android tablets indicates a significant degree of unreliability so we only recommend USB mics be used with laptops at this time. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >3.5 mm TRRS</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nTRRS mics are a newer connection style that are typically compatible with mobile devices and some laptops wired with a 4-conductor audio jack. TRRS handles both incoming audio signals and outgoing audio signals through a single jack. These mics will vary in sound quality and design. Most are ill-suited for quality audio recording due to design. However, there is at least one excellent design for voice recording at a very affordable price. The overall caution with TRRS mics is not with the mic itself, but rather with the trend of poor quality audio conversion hardware in most Android devices.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Recommended Mics</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Audio Technica AT2020USB+ (USB)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Rode NT-USB (USB)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> IK Multimedia iRig Studio Mic (USB)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> IK Multimedia iRig Mic Cast (TRRS)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Audio Technica AT2020 (XLR)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Studio Projects B1 (XLR)</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Shure SM57a (XLR)</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Our experience with Firewire interfaces is several years old and primarily with an 8 channel configuration. Therefore, even though Firewire is still an excellent option, we are unable to provide any specific recommendations on equipment.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirewire has become less popular in recent years as USB has become the preferred configuration (especially in 1-4 channel interfaces) because of advancements in USB data transfer speed, affordability and virtually 100% compatibility with any computer. In fact, Firewire connections have become extremely difficult to find on computers built in the last few years. For this reason and others, we do not recommend Firewire as a new investment for voice recording. However, if a Firewire device is available and your computer has a compatible Firewire port and chipset, the interface will likely yield excellent results.\n</p>\n</div>"

If the health of your computer is poor, or its capacities are already stretched, it could have a negative impact on recording, ranging from slowed productivity to increased cost to file corruption. Here are some suggestions to get your computer in the best condition for recording.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit2\" >Free Improvements</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe following suggestions are steps that can be taken for no cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disconnect unnecessary USB peripheral devices</strong> - It is a smart step to disconnect any USB devices not needed during recording. This will help your computer supply full, stable voltage to sensitive USB recording gear. Too many devices drawing power from USB ports can cause the voltage level to drop or fluctuate outside of required parameters.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Turn off scheduled tasks</strong> - Maintenance tasks such as a system backup or a virus scan can draw too much of your available power while recording. They can also force the computer to work very hard. These additional demands can cause the cooling fans to run faster and louder, which could add extra noise to the recording.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Turn off automatic updates</strong> - If you have programs set to auto-update, it is nearly a guarantee that at least one will decide your recording session is the ideal time to begin an update. At the very least, it will divert system resources to the updating process and interrupt your work with notifications. Sometimes updates can cause system crashes. None of these things are helpful or necessary to have happen during a recording session. Configure these settings to manual and take care of updates when it is convenient outside of recording time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Empty temporary and deleted file caches</strong> - Use a light-weight software program such as CCleaner to remove old files that have built up in your system memory over time and claim valuable RAM and hard drive space.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scan for viruses and malware</strong> - If you have viruses or malware busy in the background they can steal valuable power that you need for audio processing. Install and run excellent, free, light-weight programs such as BitDefender Free and Malwarebytes to remove any issues from your computer.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Uninstall unnecessary programs</strong> - Get rid of unnecessary programs and other items if you don't need them on your hard drive. Beside the possibility of those programs running in the background or wanting to update, they take up hard drive space. Most hard drives begin to lose speed and performance when more than 2/3's full. So maximizing space for your new audio material and “empty” space will yield the best performance.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Log out of online services</strong> - Online services (email, IM, Facebook, media streaming, etc.) draw processing power and can give distracting notification messages and sound effects. Log out of those and close the programs. To be even more efficient, disconnect from the <abbr title=\"Local Area Network\">LAN</abbr> or wireless network while recording.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Turn off Aero</strong> - Windows Aero is a feature that adds luxury to visual experience of using Windows. To do this Aero reduces the speed and performance of your laptop slightly. It is easy to turn off Aero so that that more processing power can be devoted toward your audio project. Follow these steps:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Right click anywhere on the desktop screen.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Select “Personalize” from the menu that appears.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Scroll to find the category called “Basic” themes and select one.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Low-cost Hardware Improvements</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nAudio recording can be an intensive process on CPU, RAM and Hard Drive read/write capacity. Most likely you cannot upgrade your CPU, but often the RAM and Hard Drive can be upgraded for significant results (be sure to check for compatibility and have skilled assistance, if needed, before purchasing new hardware or attempting upgrades).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Upgrade RAM</strong> - Many consumer-grade computers have room for additional RAM on the motherboard. If your computer has an unused memory channel or is rated for higher total RAM than you currently have, upgrading is typically inexpensive and not labor-intensive. Ideally you would like to have at least 4GB of total RAM, but 8GB would be much better.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Upgrade to a Solid State Drive</strong> - Changing your Hard Drive (HDD) to a Solid State Drive (SSD) will give a significant boost in performance. However, it is a much bigger process and significantly more expensive than a RAM upgrade. Prices are improving on SSD's, but expect to pay at least $US 0.75/<abbr title=\"Gigabyte\">GB</abbr> for decent quality. Replacing your 512 <abbr title=\"Gigabyte\">GB</abbr> or 1 TB HDD with an equal size SSD could easily be cost-prohibitive. But many times a SSD of 256 <abbr title=\"Gigabyte\">GB</abbr> or less could revitalize a computer if new recordings were periodically transferred to other storage drives and the computer was not storing large amounts of other data.\n</p>\n</div>"

Only one option is optimized for voice recording. Here is how to configure the proper settings:\n</p>\n<p>\nThe arrow on the dial should be turned to point to the MS setting.\nNext, toggle and hold the PLAY switch to the up position. This will cause the screen to display MS SIDE MIC LEVEL. Holding the PLAY switch upward will reduce the input sensitivity of the side stereo mics. Keep reducing until the screen indicates S:OFF (MONO).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Why these settings? As much as possible, we want maximum sound to be captured from the direction of the sound source (voice asset) and minimum sound to be captured from the other 3 directions (background noise &amp; echo reflections of voice).</em>\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Connecting to Laptop</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe Zoom H2n requires a USB → microUSB cable to connect to a laptop. A cable is not included with the mic, but is available with the Zoom H2n Accessory Kit. A USB cable with shielding is recommended.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce the cable is connected, a few settings must be selected on the LCD screen before the mic will be activated to communicate with the recording software. On the LCD screen, take the following steps:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Toggle and select AUDIO I/F</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> In the AUDIO I/F menu, toggle and select CONNECT</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nThe mic is now recognized by the software. However, one more step is necessary within the software to select the Zoom H2n as the input device. Depending on which software you are using, this if typically selected in the Preferences menu or Audio Hardware menu.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Mic Positioning</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWARNING: The side of the mic that has the LCD screen is actually the back side of the mic! If you record from the LCD screen side you will get a horrible recording.\n</p>\n<p>\nBe sure to record using the side opposite the screen (the side with the battery compartment). Another reference indicator is that the arrow on the dial will point to the correct side and a red LED is illuminated.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf possible, use a tripod stand or elevate the mic so that it is not sitting directly on a flat hard surface that will reflect sound. The threaded socket in the bottom of the H2n is compatible with Zoom stands and also should fit most camera tripod stands.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is always a good idea to record using a pop filter or windscreen. If one is available, it will greatly raise the quality of your recording. The accessory kit includes a windscreen designed to fit the shape of the Zoom H2n mic capsule.\n</p>\n<p>\nPosition the mic 4 – 6 inches from the reader and at a 45 degree angle, offset from the path of the wind of their voice. This will help to prevent volume spikes, breath noises and bassy plosives from words that begin with “P”.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Setting the Mic Gain</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe H2n has a handy gain adjustment dial on the side. Adjust gain so that the input level consistently registers between -12 and -6 dB in your editing software waveform view. Momentary peaks registering slightly above -6 dB are fine. However, hitting 0 dB should be avoided because it means the audio recording will be distorted. Distorted audio is permanently ruined and cannot be fixed later through de-amplifying.\n</p>\n</div>"

In this example, we are selecting MP3 format, 44100Hz, 128kbps. By default, MediaHuman offers this setting in stereo format, even though our source files are mono.

However, another good method would be to translate all of the translation resources for each chunk of the Bible together. In this case, for each chunk of text, you would translate the ULB and the UDB of those verses, then the translationNotes, the translationWords, and the translationQuestions for those same verses. Then you would move to the next chunk and translate each of the resources for that chunk, as well, in that order. For information about which books of the Bible to translate first, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translation_difficulty\" title=\"Choosing What to Translate\">Choosing What to Translate</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Why Translate Two Bibles into the Gateway Languages?</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nSome people might ask this question, because adequate Bibles already exist in most of the Gateway languages. However, these are end-user Bibles, designed to be read and studied by people who speak those languages in their homes and churches. The Bibles that we are translating are not end-user Bibles. They are Bibles designed to be used in conjunction with each other and with the other translation helps as a set of tools that will allow speakers of other languages to use them to translate a Bible into their own languages. What they produce from these tools will be an end-user Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo make an end-user Bible, it is always best to translate from more than one version, so that the translator doesn’t fall into the habit of following the form of any one version too closely. Also, it is always possible to translate something in more than one way in a target language, and often the biblical language has more than one possible meaning. Looking at multiple versions that between them reveal these differences gives the translator a window into those things that a single version would not give. This benefit is maximized when the two (or more) source Bibles use very different styles, such as literal and dynamic. Having a literal version and a dynamic version side by side give the translator a “three-dimensional” view into the original text, allowing him to see both the form and the meaning at the same time. It is for this purpose that we are providing the ULB and the UDB. \n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_ulb\" title=\"Translating the ULB\">Translating the ULB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_udb\" title=\"Translating the UDB\">Translating the UDB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/translation_difficulty\" title=\"Choosing What to Translate\">Choosing What to Translate</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Unlike the UDB and unlike an end-user Bible, the ULB is designed to reflect the forms of the source languages, so that the Other Language (OL) translator can see what they are. By using the ULB, the OL translator can “look through” it to see how the original Bible expressed the biblical ideas. As you translate the ULB, therefore, you must try to retain the grammatical and syntactic structures of the original as far as the target language (Gateway Language) will allow. If the original structure does not make sense in the target language, then you will need to change it into a structure that does make sense. It does no good to make a translation that the OL translator using this tool will not be able to understand. But as far as the target language will allow, retain the structures of the original in your translation of the ULB. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >What method should be used to translate the ULB?</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWhen translating the ULB, keep the English source open in front of you. This means that if you are translating using MAST methodology, do not use the step of blind drafting. The reason for this is that blind drafting is a method that translators use in order to produce natural target language translations. Through blind drafting, the translator replaces structures from the source language that would be unnatural in the target language with structures that are natural for that target language. But the ULB is a tool that must retain the original, biblical language structures in order to be useful to the translator. The best way to guard these structures is to translate with the English source ULB open in front of you so that you can be sure to keep these structures as they are in the English ULB, as far as the target language will allow. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Back Translation</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nBecause the ULB is part of a set of translation resources that will be used by many OL translators, we need to ensure that it conforms to these guidelines as closely as possible. To do this, we need to add an extra layer of checking to the process. This extra layer is a written back translation. This means that you need to have someone on the GL translation team who did not work on the translation itself, and who can translate the GL ULB back into English in a literal way, following the structure and vocabulary of the GL ULB. Then experienced translators and exegetes can read the back translation and see where there might be places that need fixing. If you are using the checking steps of MAST methodology, the back translation could be done after the key term check or after the verse-by-verse check. If the back translation is made after the key term check, then it will need to be revised to conform to any changes that are made in the verse-by-verse check. A reason to make the back translation after the key term check, however, is that it could be very helpful to a facilitator who speaks English, and could greatly speed up the verse-by-verse check since the facilitator can read the back translation before meeting with the team and already know which places they need to discuss when they meet together. This would also make it possible to eliminate some of the oral back translation that would otherwise be necessary for the verse-by-verse check. For information about how to do a back translation, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation\" title=\"Back Translation\">Back Translation</a> and following modules.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >What are the structures of the ULB that should be retained?</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe translation of the ULB needs to retain the original grammatical forms (as far as is possible), the idioms, and the figures of speech of the original so that the OL translator can consider them and use them if they communicate the right thing in the target language. If those forms get changed in a Gateway Language (GL) translation of the ULB, then the OL translator will never see them and the translationNotes about them will not make sense. Keep in mind that the ULB and the UDB are only going to be translated into the GLs, because they are translation tools for the use of the OL translator. We want these tools to be as useful as possible. For the ULB, this means that it should retain structures that we would not always retain in an end-user Bible. The GL translator must understand that this translation will lack naturalness and sometimes also lack clarity because it is aiming at reproducing these original language structures and figures of speech that may not translate well into the GL. Wherever the ULB translation lacks clarity, however, there should also be a translationNote to explain the meaning of the structure for the OL translator. The translationNotes and the UDB will provide the meaning wherever that meaning is in doubt in the ULB. In this way, the tools will work together to provide the OL translator with a full set of information about both the form and the meaning of the original Bible.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit5\" >Examples</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n</div>\n<h4 >Grammatical Forms</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of Luke 2:47 reproduces a grammatical form from the Greek source language that is also natural in English, but that might not be natural in other languages. When talking about the boy Jesus at the temple, it says, “All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.” The nouns “understanding” and “answers” refer to events, not things, and so must be translated as verbs in many languages.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB of the same verse gives an example of how these nouns can be translated as verbs. It says, “All the people who heard what he said were amazed at how much he <em>understood</em> and how well he <em>answered</em> the questions that the teachers asked.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen translating the ULB, however, these nouns should be translated as nouns if that will make sense in the target language.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Idioms</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of Matthew 2:20 reproduces an idiom from the Greek source language. It refers to Herod and his soldiers who were trying to kill the child Jesus as, “those who sought the child's life.” In some languages this is clear, and in others it is not.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB of the same verse tries to make the meaning clear by translating this idiom as, “the people who were trying to kill the child.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen translating the ULB, however, this idiom should be translated as it is, so that the Other Language translator can consider it and use it if it makes sense. The UDB and the translationNotes will provide the meaning. \n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Figures of Speech</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of John 1:17 reproduces a figure of speech from the Greek source language. It says, “grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.” (This figure of speech is called “personification;” see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_personification\" title=\"Personification\">Personification</a>.) This figure of speech talks as if grace and truth were like people who can come and go, and it talks as if Jesus Christ were like a doorway that they can come through. In some languages this makes sense, but in other languages it does not. The plain meaning is that Jesus Christ acted toward us with grace and taught us true things about God.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB of the same verse tries to make this plain meaning clear by translating it as, “Jesus Christ was kind to us far beyond what we deserved and taught us true things about God.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen translating the ULB, however, this figure of speech should be translated as it is, so that the Other Language translator can consider it and use it if it makes sense. If it does not, the UDB provides an alternative way to translate it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_adaptulb\" title=\"Adapt the ULB\">Adapt the ULB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_udb\" title=\"Translating the UDB\">Translating the UDB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Unlike the ULB and unlike an end-user Bible, the UDB does not use figures of speech, idioms, abstract nouns, or grammatical forms that are difficult to translate into many languages. The purpose of the UDB is to show the plain meaning of all of those things wherever they occur in the ULB. Because the UDB lacks these things, it is not a beautiful end-user Bible. An end-user Bible will use the figures of speech and idioms that speak naturally and beautifully in the target language, but the UDB does not use them. As the Other Language translator uses both the UDB and the ULB together as his translation source, he will be able to see the figures of speech, idioms, and other forms of the original Bible in the ULB and also see what their meaning is in the UDB. Then he can use the figures of speech or other forms from the ULB that are clear and natural in his language. When the forms in the ULB are not clear or natural in his language, then he can choose other forms in his language that have the same meaning as the UDB translation or the Notes. When translating the UDB, please do not use idioms, figures of speech, or difficult grammatical forms in the Gateway Language translation. The purpose of the UDB is to change all of these problematic grammatical forms into more universal ones to make them easier to translate, and to make the meaning as clear as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB avoids using long or complex sentences. In many languages, long or complex sentences are unnatural and unclear. When translating the UDB, keep the sentences short and simple.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB often fills in the participants when these are lacking in the original Bible and the ULB. In the original biblical languages, these participants could be left out and still understood by the reader. But in many languages these must be included for the translation to be clear and natural. When translating the UDB, therefore, be sure to include all of the participants that are there in the UDB.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >What method should be used to translate the UDB?</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nWhen translating the UDB, keep the English source open in front of you. This means that if you are translating using MAST methodology, do not use the step of blind drafting. The reason for this is that blind drafting is a method that translators use in order to produce natural target language translations. Through blind drafting, the translator replaces structures from the source language that would be unnatural in the target language with structures that are natural for that target language. But the UDB is a tool that carefully avoids certain structures that can be difficult to translate in some languages, as explained above. If the translator is using blind drafting, he might accidentally replace the simple structures of the UDB with structures that are natural in the target Gateway Language but unwanted in the UDB, such as idioms and figures of speech from the target GL. In order to guard against replacing these structures, it is best to translate the UDB with the English source text open to look at.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Back Translation</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nBecause the UDB is part of a set of translation resources that will be used by many OL translators, we need to ensure that it conforms to these guidelines as closely as possible.

When you translate the UDB, make sure that your translation of the UDB also avoids these problems.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Passive Voice</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nPassive voice is a grammatical construction that is common in Greek and English but it is not used in many other languages, so it can be very confusing. For that reason, it is not used in the UDB. In passive voice, the receiver of the action changes places with the actor. In English, the actor normally comes first in the sentence. But in passive voice, the receiver of the action comes first. Often, the actor is left unstated. In that case, the UDB will fill in the actor. See “Missing Participants” below.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, the ULB of Romans 2:24 says, “the name of God is dishonored among the Gentiles because of you.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe action is “dishonor,” the actors are “the Gentiles” (non-Jews), and the receiver of the action is “the name of God.” The reason for the action is “because of you.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB rearranges the verse to put the actor and the receiver of the action in a more normal order. It says, “The non-Jews speak evil about God because of the evil actions of you Jews.” This is more clear for many languages. When you translate the UDB, make sure that you do not use any passive voice constructions.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Abstract Nouns</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of Romans 2:10 says, “But praise, honor, and peace will come to everyone who practices good…”\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this verse, the words “praise,” “honor,” “peace,” and “good” are abstract nouns. That is, they are words that refer to things that we cannot see or touch. They are ideas. The ideas that these nouns express are closer to actions or descriptions than they are to things. In many languages, therefore, these ideas must be expressed by verbs or description words, not by nouns.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor this reason, the UDB expresses these nouns as actions or descriptions. It says, “But God will praise, honor, and give a peaceful spirit to every person who habitually does good deeds.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen translating the UDB, avoid using abstract nouns. For more information on abstract nouns, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/translate/figs_abstractnouns\" title=\"Abstract Nouns\">Abstract Nouns</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Long, Complex Sentences</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB translates the first three verses of Romans as one complex sentence. It says, “<sup>1</sup> Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, <sup>2</sup> which he promised beforehand by his prophets in the holy scriptures, <sup>3</sup> concerning his Son, who was born from the descendants of David according to the flesh.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB breaks that into five sentences that are more simple in form. It says, “<sup>1</sup> I, Paul, who serve Christ Jesus, am writing this letter to all of you believers in the city of Rome. God chose me to be an apostle, and he appointed me in order that I should proclaim the good news that comes from him. <sup>2</sup> Long before Jesus came to earth, God promised that he would reveal this good news by means of what his prophets wrote in the sacred scriptures. <sup>3</sup> This good news is about his Son. As to his Son's physical nature, he was born a descendant of King David.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen translating the UDB, keep the sentences short and simple.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Missing Participants</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nIn the ULB, Romans 1:1 says, “Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God…”\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this verse, there is a participant that is left unstated, but still understood. This participant is God. It is God who called Paul to be an apostle and who set him apart for the Gospel. In some languages, this participant must be stated. \n</p>\n<p>\nTherefore the UDB of Romans 1:1 says, “God chose me to be an apostle, and he appointed me in order that I should proclaim the good news that comes from him.”\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen translating the UDB, be sure to include all of the participants that are there in the UDB.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Events out of Order</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of Luke 2:6-7 says, “<sup>6</sup> Now it came about that while they were there, the time came for her to deliver her baby. <sup>7</sup> She gave birth to a son, her firstborn child, and she wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth. Then she put him in an animal feeding trough, because there was no room for them in a guest room.”\n</p>\n<p>\nIn some languages, events need to be told in the order in which they happened, or else the story will be confusing and hard to understand. People might understand from these verses that Mary delivered her baby outside in the street, and then looked for somewhere to stay and, after a long search, ended up putting him in an animal feeding trough. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe UDB tells these events in the order in which they happened, so that it is clear that Mary was already in the shelter for animals when she gave birth. It says, “<sup>6-7</sup> When they arrived in Bethlehem, there was no place for them to stay in a place where visitors usually stayed. So they had to stay in a place where animals slept overnight. While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in wide strips of cloth and placed him in the feeding place for the animals.”\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Figures of Speech</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of Romans 2:21 says, “You who preach not to steal, do you steal?”\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a figure of speech called a rhetorical question. It is not a real question that is used to seek an answer. It is used to make a point. In this case, Paul is using it to scold his audience and to condemn their hypocrisy. Many languages do not use rhetorical questions, or they do not use them in this way. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo show how to translate this meaning without a rhetorical question, the UDB says, “You who preach that people should not steal things, it is disgusting that you yourself steal things!”\nWhen you translate the UDB, be sure to not use rhetorical questions or other figures of speech. For more examples of figures of speech, see ta-figs_intro and the modules linked there.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Idioms</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThe ULB of Deuteronomy 32:10 says, “he guarded him as the apple of his eye.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe word “apple” here does not refer to a kind of fruit, but instead refers to the pupil, the dark center of a person's eye. The phrase “the apple of his eye” is an idiom that refers to anything that is extremely precious to a person, or the one thing that is the most precious to a person. In many languages this idiom makes no sense, but they have other idioms that have this meaning. The Other Language translator should use one of these idioms from the target language in the OL translation, but there should be no idiom in the translation of the UDB.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo show the meaning of this verse, the UDB expresses this in plain language, without an idiom. It says, “He protected them and took care of them, as every person takes good care of his own eyes.”\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Notes add another way to translate this that makes the meaning clear. It says, “He protected the people of Israel as something most valuable and precious.” When you translate the UDB, be sure that you do not use any idioms. Only use plain language that makes the meaning clear. For more information on idioms, see ta-figs_idiom.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more examples of how the UDB avoids difficult grammatical constructions, idioms, and figures of speech, see the section of examples in <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_ulb\" title=\"Translating the ULB\">Translating the ULB</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_notes\" title=\"Translate the translationNotes\">Translate the translationNotes</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/check_udb\" title=\"Checking the UDB\">Checking the UDB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

That is, it should follow the same order of clauses as the original biblical languages and reproduce the original biblical idioms and figures of speech. Most Bibles that were translated into Gateway Languages in the first half of the twentieth century or earlier are literal translations. \n</p>\n<p>\nIt is also necessary that the Bible that you adapt as the ULB not be encumbered by copyright. That means that it must be in the public domain or have a license that permits us to reproduce and translate it. For more information on copyrights and licensing, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/intro/open_license\" title=\"Open License\">Open License</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the Bible is very old, you will need to update the language and the style so that it uses words that people use now and “talks” in the way that people talk now. Even though the ULB has a literal style, it must use words that people know so that they can understand it.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Methodology for Adapting an Existing Translation for the ULB</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nBecause adapting an existing translation is a process of editing rather than of translating, the first four steps of the MAST process cannot be used for this. Especially do not use the step of blind drafting. Instead, you should follow these steps:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Read the chapter in the English ULB and the Notes for that chapter. If you are beginning to translate a book, also read the overview of the book. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Read the chapter in the Bible that you are adapting as the ULB. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Go through the chapter and change old words to words that people use now. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Using the list of translationWords for that chapter, check to make sure that a good translation for each of those words is used in the Gateway Language ULB.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1 node\"><div class=\"li\"> If some sentences are put together in a strange way, check to see if they are also that way in the English ULB.</div>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> If the sentences are also put together in that same strange way in the English ULB, it is because the original Bible has that structure. Leave them as they are. There will be a Note that will explain that structure.</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level2\"><div class=\"li\"> If the sentences are not put together in that same strange way in the English ULB, then change the sentence so that it is clearer for modern readers.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If you see that any verse or phrase in the Bible that you are adapting is very different than the English ULB, then change it so that it is more like the English ULB. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> If you see that any verse is missing in the Bible that you are adapting but it is there in the English ULB, then translate that verse from the English ULB.</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nAfter you do these things so that the text is ready to use as the Gateway Language ULB, you will need to translate the translationNotes. As you translate the translationNotes, you may see that there are parts of your adapted ULB that should be different so that the translationNote can make sense. Also, you may see that some translationNotes need to be changed so that they can refer to the right parts of the adapted ULB. In this way, you will need to make changes to both the Gateway Language ULB and the Notes as you adapt them to each other so that they make sense and are truly helpful for the OL translator. For more information about this process, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_notes\" title=\"Translate the translationNotes\">Translate the translationNotes</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit4\" >Back Translation</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nBecause the ULB is part of a set of translation resources that will be used by many OL translators, we need to ensure that it conforms to these guidelines as closely as possible. To do this, we need to add an extra layer of checking to the process. This extra layer is a written back translation. This means that you need to have someone on the GL translation team who can translate the adapted GL ULB into English in a literal way, following the structure and vocabulary of the GL ULB. Then experienced translators and exegetes can read the back translation and see where there might be places that need fixing. If you are using the checking steps of MAST methodology, the back translation could be done after the key term check or after the verse-by-verse check. If the back translation is made after the key term check, then it will need to be revised to conform to any changes that are made in the verse-by-verse check. A reason to make the back translation after the key term check, however, is that it could be very helpful to a facilitator who speaks English, and could greatly speed up the verse-by-verse check since the facilitator can read the back translation before meeting with the team and already know which places they need to discuss when they meet together. This would also make it possible to eliminate some of the oral back translation that would otherwise be necessary for the verse-by-verse check. For information about how to do a back translation, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/checking/vol2_backtranslation\" title=\"Back Translation\">Back Translation</a> and following modules.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_notes\" title=\"Translate the translationNotes\">Translate the translationNotes</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/intro/open_license\" title=\"Open License\">Open License</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

You must have the ULB available so that you can copy the part of the ULB text that the translationNote is talking about directly into the translationNote. You must also have the UDB text already translated and available, because the translationNotes often copy part of the UDB text in order to show another way to translate the same part of the verse. Other times, the translationNote does not quote the UDB but it does refer to it. In that case, you need to be able to see what the UDB says in order to translate the translationNote in the best way.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition, the translationNotes directly comment on parts of the ULB text, so you must read the part of the ULB text that the translationNote comments on in order to properly translate the translationNote. After you read and understand the ULB text, then you can translate the translationNote so that it makes sense together with the ULB text that it refers to.\n</p>\n<p>\nDo not use the method of blind drafting to translate the translationNotes. Always translate the translationNotes with the Gateway Language ULB and UDB in front of you, and the English translationNotes also visible. This is because you must copy the ULB phrase into the translationNote exactly as it is in the ULB, and you must also copy the UDB phrase if the translationNote also quotes the UDB. \n</p>\n<p>\nOften, the translationNotes offer alternative ways to translate a phrase from the ULB. It is important that the phrase that you use to translate this kind of translationNote be a direct substitute for the phrase that it replaces in the ULB. In other words, the phrase has to have the same grammatical construction as the phrase in the ULB. That is, it needs to fit into the sentence in the ULB just like the original phrase did. In order to make sure that the phrase in the GL Note fits the sentence in the GL ULB, you must be able to always look at both the English translationNote and the GL ULB as you translate. Translating the translationNotes while having the source visible, therefore, is the most efficient way to translate them and this will also reduce the number of errors in translation. For more information on the types of translationNotes, see <a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol1/translate/resources_types\" title=\"translationNotes\">translationNotes</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Adapting the translationNotes</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nOften, the ULB in the target Gateway Language will say things in a different way than the ULB said them in English. In order for the translationNote to be useful in the target Gateway Language, you will need to adapt the translationNote so that it talks about the text of the ULB as it is in the Gateway Language translation. This means that you will need to copy the phrase of the Gateway ULB that is the translation of the same phrase from the English ULB into the translationNote, and then sometimes change the translationNote so that it makes sense and is helpful for the Other Language translator who will use these translationNotes as translation tools.\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause languages can be very different from each other, sometimes there will be translationNotes that are important and necessary for some languages, but that are not needed for other languages. If there is a translationNote that does not make sense when applied to the ULB text in the target Gateway Language, then you as the translator will need to modify the translationNote so that it does make sense in relation to the ULB in your target Gateway Language. If the translationNote does not apply at all to the target GL text of the ULB, then you may delete that note from your translation of the translationNotes. But be sure to think about it very carefully before you delete a translationNote, to be sure that it is not necessary for the GL translation.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the same reason, sometimes you will realize that the Other Language translator will need a translationNote in order to understand a phrase in the target Gateway Language ULB, but there might not be a translationNote already written for that phrase, because it was not necessary for the English ULB. In that case, you will need to write a new translationNote and include it in your translation. Usually these translationNotes will be to explain a phrase or way of saying something that is normal in the Gateway Language but that is not normal in the Other Languages that you know of. When writing your translationNote, follow the same style and format of the existing translationNotes. \n</p>\n<p>\nRemember that speakers of many different languages will be using these Gateway Language translationNotes to help them translate the Bible. There will be many things that you will understand about the Bible in the Gateway Language that the OL translator may not understand. For that reason, if you think that there is something difficult to understand in the GL ULB, write a translationNote that can help the OL translator to understand it. There will probably be many Other Language translators who will benefit from reading the translationNote and who will make a better translation because of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause the translationNotes need to be adapted in these ways and not simply translated, it is best if the people adapting the translationNotes be people who are well educated in biblical studies so that they can understand the various problems that the translationNotes explain.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h4 >Back Translating the translationNotes</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nBecause the translationNotes are part of a set of translation resources that will be used by many OL translators, we need to ensure that they conform to these guidelines as closely as possible. To do this, we need to add an extra layer of checking to the process. This extra layer is a written back translation. This means that you need to have someone on the GL translation team who did not work on the translation of the translationNotes, and who can translate the GL translationNotes back into English in a literal way, following the structure and vocabulary of the GL translationNotes.

But some of the words in the Bible are not used in everyday life in our time or in our cultures, and so the translator may not be familiar with them. Other words are used in everyday life, but they are used in a different way in the Bible. Some of these words have very important or special meanings in the Bible. They tell us a lot about God and his relationship with us. So in order for the Other Language translator to completely understand these words, we have provided the definitions in the translationWords list. When you translate this list into the Gateway Language, it will help all of the Other Language translators who will use it to translate the Bible for their people with good understanding.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 class=\"sectionedit3\" >Guidelines for Translating the translationWords</h3>\n<div class=\"level3\">\n<p>\nThe translationWords definitions have several parts. The first part is “Definition.” This gives the meaning of the word as it is used in the Bible. Please do not use definitions from a modern Gateway Language dictionary, because the way words are used in the Bible can be different from the way they are used in modern, everyday life. We want to make sure that the Other Language translator understands the way that the word is used in the Bible. \n</p>\n<p>\nIt is possible that the Gateway Language might express the meaning of the English word by different words, with each of those words having part of the meaning of the English word. In this case, you will need to list each of those words at the top, separated by commas. Several of the English translationWord entries already have multiple words at the top like this, such as “prophet, prophecy, prophesy, seer, prophetess” (see <a class=\"urlextern\" href=\"https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/prophet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/prophet\">https://door43.org/en/obe/kt/prophet</a> ). Then, in the “Definition” part, you will need to list those words in separate paragraphs with a definition for each one. The Other Language translator can then choose the word that he needs to understand from that list and translate it correctly in the passage that he is translating.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe second part of the translationWords entry is “Translation Suggestions” or “Translation Strategies.” This section gives different ideas for how the Other Language translator can translate the word. This section gives more than one way to translate the translationWord because the translationWord can mean slightly different things in different contexts. Be sure that you understand the differences of meaning between the different contexts in which the translationWord is used so that you can translate them correctly. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn the Gateway Language, some of the translationWords are not used in all of the same contexts as the English translationWords are. In that case, you will need to adjust your translation. If one of the Translation Suggestions does not work in the Gateway Language, then do not translate that Translation Suggestion. Instead, write a Translation Suggestion that shows how that translationWord is used in the Gateway Language. Think about the different ways that the translationWord is used in the Bible, and try to make sure that there is a Translation Suggestion for each of the primary uses of the translationWord. We want the Other Language translator to see and consider the differences and the similarity in meaning between the uses of the translationWord so that he can choose the best word in his language to express those meanings. \n</p>\n<p>\nAs you translate the ULB and UDB, you may find that you need to add a meaning to a word in the translationWords entry, or you may need to add another word to the entry because the Gateway Language uses more than one word for the idea of that important translationWord. Go ahead and do this as you find more words or meanings for the words. \n</p>\n<p>\nUnder the “Translation Suggestions” or “Translation Strategies” section is a line that says, “(See also…).” You only need to translate the words “See also,” and you only need to translate this one time, not for every translationWord. The rest of the line will be created automatically, if the translation is done in translationStudio Desktop.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe third and fourth parts are “Bible References” and “Examples from the Bible Stories.” You only need to translate these words of the titles, and you only need to translate them one time, not for every translationWord. You do not need to translate the rest of these parts. They will be created automatically, if the translation is done in translationStudio Desktop.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_questions\" title=\"Translate the translationQuestions\">Translate the translationQuestions</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

Work through the translationQuestions for that chapter of the ULB, translating each pair of questions and answers. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> When you finish translating each question-answer pair for that chapter, go back and do the checking steps, comparing your translation with the English source questions and answers. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Now compare your translation of each answer with the Gateway Language ULB of that verse. It is important that your answer to each translationQuestion match very closely to the words of the ULB. At this step, you may need to adjust the words of your answers so that they are the same as the words of the ULB. This is so the OL translators and checkers of the OL translation can use your questions and answers and easily see if the their translation is communicating the right message. When the words of your answer are the same as the words of the ULB, the OL checker can see where that answer is in the translation and know what part of their translation they need to make more clear if the person answering the question gives a different answer. </div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h4 >Modified MAST Method</h4>\n<div class=\"level4\">\n<p>\nThis is an alternative method for translating the translationQuestions.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Read the chapter of the ULB that the translationQuestions are about, so that you understand it. </div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> Translate only the question part of each question-answer pair using the MAST method of blind drafting.

If the words are arranged differently, ask yourself if they could be arranged the same as the words in the English ULB and still make good sense, or if it is necessary for them to be arranged in a different way in the Gateway Language ULB. If they would still make good sense in a way that an Other Language translator would understand, then put them in the same arrangement as in the English.

The UDB will very often not be natural, because it avoids some forms that languages naturally use, such as idioms and figures of speech. The UDB avoids these, however, because they are specific to individual languages, and do not translate well from one language to another.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is useful to check the UDB for clarity with speakers of the Gateway Language, but do not confuse clarity with naturalness. You can read a passage from the UDB to a speaker of the Gateway Language, and ask if the meaning is clear. If they say, “Yes,” that is enough. If they also say, “But I would say it differently,” that is fine. We expect that they would say it differently. But the UDB needs to say it in a plain way. As long as the meaning of the GL UDB is clear, it is a successful translation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/gl_notes\" title=\"Translate the translationNotes\">Translate the translationNotes</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><span class=\"curid\"><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/check_udb\" title=\"Checking the UDB\">Checking the UDB</a></span></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/check_notes\" title=\"Checking the translationNotes\">Checking the translationNotes</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"

So you must check the meaning of the Note in the English translationNotes and make sure that the GL translationNote has the same meaning. Then you must also check the wording of the phrase that comes from the ULB and make sure that the words are exactly the same.\n - In the same way, make sure that any quotations of the UDB have the exact wording of the GL UDB. \n - Check that the GL translationNote makes sense with the GL ULB. It is possible that the GL translator made a good translation of the English source translationNote, but when the translationNote is read with the new GL ULB, it might not explain the GL ULB in the right way, or it might not make sense with the GL ULB. In that case, you will need to discuss the problem with the translator. Then you will need to decide how to change the translationNote so that it explains the GL ULB in a way that will be helpful to the OL translator. \n - In the same way, check that all references to the UDB make sense with the GL UDB.\n - If the GL translator has decided that a translationNote does not apply to the GL ULB and has deleted the note from the GL translationNotes, check to make sure that the translationNote truly was not needed.\n - If the GL translator has written a new translationNote, check to make sure that it truly was needed, and that it makes sense with the GL ULB.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to check the translationNotes for naturalness and clarity, you will need to have people read them together with the GL ULB and UDB. Then ask them to mark anything that is not clear to them, or that they would say in a different way. Then give this feedback to the translator so that he can make those places clearer and more natural.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Next we recommend you learn about:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/check_udb\" title=\"Checking the UDB\">Checking the UDB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"level1\"><div class=\"li\"> <em><a class=\"wikilink1\" href=\"/en/ta/vol2/gateway/check_ulb\" title=\"Checking the ULB\">Checking the ULB</a></em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>"
