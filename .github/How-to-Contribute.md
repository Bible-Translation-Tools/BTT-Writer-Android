# How to Contribute

These rules apply to contributions made to the [BTT-Writer-Android] and [BTT-Writer-Desktop] repositories.

##License
By contributing to these projects you agree to the release your code according to the license specified in the LICENSE file in the relative repository.

##Expectations
These projects use [Git] and [GitHub] to manage all code and issues. You must be familiar with both [Git] and [GitHub] in order to be an effective contributor. Please take the time to search for and read all relevant documentation on these tools before asking for help.

##Definitions
* **upstream** refers to the repository owned by [Bible-Translation-Tools](https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools) e.g. [BTT-Writer-Desktop] or [BTT-Writer-Android].

##Start to Finish
Contributing is very easy.

1. Fork the upstream repository. See [Fork a repo] for instructions.
2. Follow the quick start guide in the upstream README.
3. Use the [git branching model]. More specifically create branch for your feature/fix from the develop branch. e.g. `issue123`
4. Add a feature, fix a bug, or make something awesome.
5. Push your local branch to your fork.
6. Create a pull request to the development branch on the upstream repository. See [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for instructions.

##Cloning Instructions
If you are new to git or github all the cloning, branching, and forking can be confusing. Here is a quick step by step tutorial to help you set up your repositories.

1. **Create a github account**. Once you have an account you'll probably want to generate an ssh key so you don't have to enter your username and password each time you push your code to github. Read the [Generating SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/) article for further instructions.
2. **Fork the upstream repository**. See [Fork a repo] for instructions. You do not have permission to change the upstream repository directly so you need to copy (fork) it.
3. **Clone your fork**. This will place a copy of your forked repository onto your computer where you will work on the code.
3. **Add upstream as a remote**. This will allow you to pull updates from the upstream repository into your repository. See [Configuring a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/) for instructions.
