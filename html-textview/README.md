# HtmlTextView for Android

HtmlTextView is an extended TextView component for Android, which can load HTML and converts it into Spannable for displaying it.
It is a replacement for usage of the WebView component, which behaves strange on some Android versions, flickers while loading, etc.

## Tags supported by Android ([history of Html class](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/commits/master/core/java/android/text/Html.java))
* ``<p>``
* ``<div>`` handled exactly like ``<p>``
* ``<br>``
* ``<b>``
* ``<i>``
* ``<strong>`` ([bug on some Android versions: generates italic](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3473))
* ``<em>`` ([bug on some Android versions: generates bold](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=3473))
* ``<u>``
* ``<strike>``
* ``<tt>``
* ``<dfn>``

## Extended support by HtmlTextView
* ``<ul>``
* ``<ol>``
* ``<dd>``
* ``<li>``
* ``<code>``
* ``<center>``

The library also includes a workaround to prevent TextView from crashing on [specific Android versions](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=35466) and the possibility to load images from local drawables folder or from the Internet.

This library is kept tiny without external dependencies.
I am using it to provide Help/About Activities in my apps.

## Example

```java
HtmlTextView text = new HtmlTextView(this);

// loads html from string and displays cat_pic.png from the app's drawable folder
text.setHtmlFromString("<h2>Hello wold</h2><ul><li>cats</li><li>dogs</li></ul><img src=\"cat_pic\"/>", true);
```
or
```java
HtmlTextView text = new HtmlTextView(this);

// loads html from string and displays http://www.example.com/cat_pic.png from the Internet
text.setHtmlFromString("<h2>Hello wold</h2><ul><li>cats</li><li>dogs</li></ul><img src=\"http://www.example.com/cat_pic.png\"/>", false);
```
or
```java
HtmlTextView text = new HtmlTextView(this);

// loads html from raw resource, i.e., a html file in res/raw/, this allows translatable resource (e.g., res/raw-de/ for german)
text.setHtmlFromRawResource(this, R.raw.help, true);
```

## Use library as Gradle dependency (Android library project)

1. Copy the cloned folder to your project and define it in your ``settings.gradle`` with ``include ':html-textview'``
2. Add dependency ``compile project(':html-textview')`` to your project's ``build.gradle``.
